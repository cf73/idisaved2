        text: "explores the depth of perception in design as a contemplative process to unfold and enfold meaning. For this practice semiotics and mindfulness are used: semiotics as an intellectual method to probe the mechanisms of meaning; and mindfulness to go deeper into the subject of how meaning unfolds in the design process, and how to enfold meaning in the forms we produce. We will consider how the dynamics of individual consciousness plays a critical role in the design process, and how mindfulness and attention help reveal the nature of authenticity.\_"

        text: 'In studio work is both assigned and open to individual project interests (BFA Degree Project, MFA thesis, etc.) one can use of any medium. The course, studio based, includes lectures to cover historical, scientific and philosophical interests: i.e., theosophy (a modern secular representation of perennial wisdom that deeply inspired many individuals such as Kandinsky, Mondrian, TS Elliot, Scriabin, Einstein, Edison) to help us map out the ground and nature of being; Concretism (spawned by theosophy) in art, poetry, music, bookworks, and performance art; parallel inquiries by Duchamp, Cage, Fluxus, Viola; and theories that go beyond the post-modern mind such as the implicate order of wholeness, systems theory, dissonance and indeterminacy. The course requires students to come with an eager intellect, prepared to work hard with a willingness to embark on a journey with open minds to carefully attend to whatever the experience unfolds as meaning enfolds into the work that serves as poetic pillows.'
