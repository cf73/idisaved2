Since that was no longer going to be the case, I decided to create this booklet myself and publish it posthumously in celebration of Kirsten’s life, 1965–1989. This commemorative motive also created by default the fact that my wife (Susan) and I became editors of sorts for the booklet, in which we decided to add a few poems we found in her archive, adding those we thought worth adding to create the set of 14 poems.'

Thus, my designer question sought how to translate the original poems into a published work and what this might mean to decisions regarding the use of fonts, formatting, placement, etc.'

That is for the practical nature of legibility, of course; but also, for how the visual language unavoidably mediates the words within the poem and will expresses potential moods, feelings, volumes, elegance, and so on.'

So, I also began to play with formats, limited this to inexpensive commercial printers, and planning only a small edition with enough copies to share with interested people like my family, and friends Kirsten’s and ours. For its format I used the golden section to fit within the basic 8.5 x 11-inch, hence: 7.75x10.75-inch for 24 pages total. I also first limited printing to one color, then changed that to use two colors.\_"

Thus, I started by viewing the poems set in type using common fonts arbitrarily (but leaning toward a serif as convention might have it), and by seeing this in variations of regular, bold and italics."

            text: "\_Having not determined any rules for typography my open mind began to question basic assumptions for layout, scale and placement. Taking in the content of this poem I felt a need to create for its design a sense of gentle play, as the poet tried to express in the words and lines of the poem. I started setting the poem digitally, using small typographic indentations to break the monotony of the typewriter layout. This created a new freer flow for reading the lines, and that all did not interfere with the poet’s written intentions for reading the words and lines. In other words, it felt right to give visual support for the “voice” for reading the poem’s purpose and content."
