            text: 'This is an inquiry into the boundless nature and energy of language. It is an imaginative journey, illustrating the ways we communicate through language – aurally, orally, and visually. It transforms the experience of sound into typographic form – it propels the typographic word into aural existence. In various projects ranging from purely typographic studies to animated media the rhythm of language is activated, capturing the essence of sight and sound; as a result, the spoken and written word are experienced more vividly.'
