            text: 'Design decisions, conditioned by culture and preconceptions, are often too trained and formula-driven, leading to convention and predictability. This thesis takes the position that, in our search for fulfilling design, a balancing act between control and disruption must be engaged.'

            text: 'By loosening the limitations of control and embracing disruption, we invite the unpredictable and unexpected into our work. This thesis process navigates the space between intention and non-intention, between inside and outside, and between the known and the unknown as a break from conditioned response. '
