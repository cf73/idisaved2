            text: "TV Documentracings\_are drawings documentracings from a live television screen and programs. First a sheet of tracing paper was placed on the television screen, followed by literally tracing lines and other visual fragments in their place as they appeared. Since the TV images are inherently kinetic the selection of fragments was only possible for as long as the image was frozen in space; and was considered “complete” as soon as the TV image began to move again or disappeared. One rule was to never add or otherwise distort that traced fragment, for to leave it simply as a fragment that had its beginning and end by that chance operation in time/space. In addition to the linear/visual fragments, other fragments were selected via listening to sounds or use of spoken words. These fragments were also extracted from the TV program by some preestablished system to keep them as “units” (for example, words spoken together).\_"

            text: "Each drawing was approached by experimenting with different sets of systems or rules. For example: a) the number of lines selected was determined by the number of commercials that interrupted the TV program; b) the ending of a traced line became the place to put the word selected from listening; c) an overall grid on the screen created frames according to the number of commercials the program had, and each space from top left to right and then down became a place for making the tracings that happened within that space. These rules, established beforehand, were an integral part of the very idea to make a documentracing, thereby playing with the creative principles for surprise, so-called accident, and the unexpected—clearly all the “chance operations” that were the very impulse for doing these experiments in concretism; i.e., the fact that creativity has generally be perceived as an act to “create” something new (no seen or realized before), yet retaining the human tendency to operate deterministically as guided by the subjective desires or projection of thoughts (hence the “expected”). At the very heart of the documentracing process was to gain insight in the unexpected, unpredicted, and become “disoriented” by the result in order to truly see the new for new insights.\_"
