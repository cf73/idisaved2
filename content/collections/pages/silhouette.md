Design notes: since the poems reflect this perspective of autobiographic nature as “silhouettes” the sub-series by that title are all designed in forms that represent the letters of the poet’s first name; the booklet was posthumously published, after she met with a fatal accident in her first parachute flight in 1989. This is an edition of unnumbered copies primarily meant to share Kirsten’s work with those who knew her; 24 pages, 19.7 x 27.5 cm, printed offset on Mohawk Superfine paper."
