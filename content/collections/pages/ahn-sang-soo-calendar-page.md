However, in the eastern wisdom tradition\_what we call the concrete reality (versus the abstract sense of reality) is actually known as a\_false (illusionistic) reality called Maya; while on the other hand, what we consider the\_illusive, abstract sense of “knowing” is actually the deeper and True “Reality”—which in our human evolution we will gradually unfold into our conscious awareness. Tom mentions this only since these wisdom teachings became the very basis for\_Theo van Doesburg to declare (in 1930) that what had been labeled as “Abstract Art” should really be called “Concrete Art”, or Concretism. From that developed the idea of Concrete Poetry."
