            text: "My visual work of the last year has focused on this question of transformation, displacement and meaning.

This can be seen as an intention to cancel, redirect and reorganize the forms of meaning that have gone before. Perceptual systems of language were investigated, image and text paired in an active relationship that challenged their syntactic stability and pushed the limits of their interpretation. \t\t\t"

            text: 'Altering the relationship between the interpreter and the message, through a set of visual operations that displace and transform, imposes a critical way of seeing that releases the work from the bonds which previously claimed to define and circumscribe it.'
