            text: 'There are forces at work all around us that are not typically thought of as “positive” or “progressive”— forces such as accident, arbitrariness, chance, imperfection, chaos, entropy, and decay. Although many consider such forces to be degenera-tive or negative, this thesis takes the stand that communication can harness the power of these enduring forces to work with them rather than against them.'

            text: 'As we work toward some notion of progress or perfection, we perceive these “negative” forces as the enemy. Often, we strive to overcome them or to transcend their effects, or we just ignore them. But the physical, material universe is governed by specific laws that are ceaselessly enforced. As long as the universe exists as we know it, somehow we will have to coexist with these forces, including not only the “positive” forces, but their “negative” counterparts as well.'

            text: 'design can incorporate such elements as limitation, distortion, appropriation, accident, arbitrariness, entropy, chaos, fragmentation, simultaneity and decay to express the world of which it is an integral part. If communication is going to exist within and communicate about this imperfect world, then it can benefit from understanding and working together with these powerful, inevitable forces.'
