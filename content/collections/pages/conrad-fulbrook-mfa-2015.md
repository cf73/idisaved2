            text: 'Thaumazein is the ancient Greek word Aristotle used to describe wonder. But why not just say ‘wonder’? Thaumazein, more specifically, means exploration of our own experience. That state of the dimly intuited awareness of boundaries, probing our confines, the sense of coming up against something that you don’t understand yet you deeply experience. So it is the first stage of discovery.'

            text: 'Today the broad science of Aristotle’s time has been narrowed into a very empirical way of knowing the world, and our wonder is channeled into materialist conceptions of humanity. I think this is a shame, because we miss much of what can be discovered about human experience. Like a scientist, the artist investigates, makes hypotheses, or like Darwin who didn’t have a hypothesis but wanted to explore the natural world, the artist is a scientist and an explorer in the experiential realm.'

            text: 'In philosophy, Husserl talks about the ‘object’ as existing not ‘out there’ as a stable thing with inherent properties, but rather as being constituted dynamically by us through active investigation. This poses some fascinating issues for me as a designer, which I hope will lead to some exciting work.'
