            text: ', holds 10 silkscreened prints of “found” concrete poems. This series of prints present the viewer with a different kind of “stamp collection”— one that focuses attention on the relationship of existing postage stamps found with their cancellations on mailed envelopes. Although their relationships may appear obvious to serve their practical purpose and thus not require any further attention, this creates an unexpected expressive result with often a powerful poetic result—which we tend to overlook due to their small scale (and indeed, we often overlook the small things in life!).'

            text: 'To create this portfolio of serigraphs I simply enlarged the original postage stamp with its respective cancellation and deleted all extraneous surrounding matter to focus attention on what their chance combination held. The poetic results ranges from the humorous to the revolting. In most cases the subject matter used our country’s representations of symbols—which creates the ironic note that the combined graphic elements were actually created by one of our governmental offices . That said, imagine for a moment the reality that our government “promotes” the very idea that “war is better business”, or decided to shoot holes through our national flag, or made a Duchamp’s Mona Lisa out of Eleanor Roosevelt!'

            text: 'Again, the stamps and their cancellations were simply proportionately enlarged but printed without any alterations—except for the fact that their combined result was printed in one color merely to enhance their combined relationship. Selections for the portfolio were limited to US stamps— realizing the endless possibilities that are created daily on a national and international scale.'

Prints are enlarged US postage stamps with their postal cancellations found on mailed envelopes, in which their accidental fusions of words and images created a unique sense of poetics.
