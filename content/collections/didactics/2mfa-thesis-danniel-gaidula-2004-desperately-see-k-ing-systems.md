            text: 'SYSTEM: A system is a set of rules whose application to a set of interrelated objects produces a unified whole transcending the individual parts. Systems are comprised of three distinct elements: systematic operations, systemic application of those operations, and the resultant wholeness of the system as a functioning unit.'

            text: 'SYSTEMATIC OPERATIONS: A set of rules which govern the behavior of an interrelated set or sets of objects to produce a predictable outcome. Traditional defini- tions of ‘systematic’ include ‘proceeding according to method’ and ‘characterized by order.’ Systematic opera- tions are designed to produce outcomes, but may not affect the wholeness of the system.'

            text: 'Principles of the course, Concrete Books, taught by Thomas Ockerse at the Rhode Island School of Design were employed in the creation of a game. This game is concrete in that its forms and modes of play are derived from the findings of this study and form a parallel ‘text’ comprised of the dialog between its constituent parts, rules, modes of play and those that interact with it.'
