            text: '. For this bookwork each letter-poem was reproduced faithfully to the originals, with black parts printed offset, then adding color, cutouts, folds, fragments, tip-ins, etc. by hand. This edition also adds another concrete poem uniquely produced for this bookwork based on the “alphabet” theme. This is a limited boxed edition of 150 numbered copies of 27 plates plus cover, 16 x 16 cm., each edition signed by the author.'
