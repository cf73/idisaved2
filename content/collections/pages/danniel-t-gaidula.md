            text: 'Humans are inherently both seekers and makers of pattern. A pattern is defined as both a “customary way of operation” and “[to] plan or create according to a model or models.” Both the “operations” and “models” in question above belong to a larger class of objects known as “systems.” A system is a set of rules which govern the behavior of an interrelated set or sets of objects which produce a unified whole. It is this harmony, order, and wholeness among all things that the maker wishes to convey and the seeker to understand. This sense of order and wholeness attracts our attention, but once engaged how do we truly “see” and experience its wholeness? What lessons can we learn from it?'
