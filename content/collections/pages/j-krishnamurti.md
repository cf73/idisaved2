            text: "\_(1895â€”1986) was an Indian philosopher, teacher, speaker, and writer. At a young age a leader of the Theosophical Society identified him as a savior to humanity and therefore he was raised to become a World Teacher. Krishnamurti rejected this title and dissociated himself from this relationship with the Theosophical Society. Instead, he began to walk his own path without having any attachment to groups or individuals. Traveling that path, he became a world teacher after all.\_\_"
