            text: 'In principle the map starts by placing a word, image or object in the center of a page (any size) to maintain awareness of what is stimulated by the mind. Creating that center, versus making a “list” as linear path wherein we tend to lose sight of source and value, maintains the interactive nature and values that parts and wholes can have.'

            text: "The term “mind-map” was popularized by British psychologist Tony Buzan, in the late 1970s; and inspired by Alfred Korzybski’s General Semantics theory. However, the term “mind-map” is somewhat misleading since the system does not truly “map the mind”, but merely documents aspects of “thought” and insight. Actually, long before Buzan others used the same mapping system for similar purposes (e.g., 3rd cent. Greek philosopher, Porphyry, used it to map out Aristotle’s categories; Ernest Wood, 1930s, used this as a means to train concentration skills). Therefore the very mind mapping represents the actions of mapping relational aspects that can come to mind into an organized form of materialization.\_\_(Thomas Ockerse)"
