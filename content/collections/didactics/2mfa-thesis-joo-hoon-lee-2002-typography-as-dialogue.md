            text: 'An empty space remains vague until it is filled. Adding even a small dot activates this space as a medium that frames and structures communication. To place a word or text within this space increases a dialogue with the audience. Typographic arrangement for reading the words completely transforms that space into a significant context for understanding. Fontography, or the creation of context-specific fonts, further enhances this notion of typographic expression to visually affect meaning, and therefore the dialogic exchange between the reader and the words. This thesis experiments with this typographic playground that engages the reader in a lively and informative dialogic interaction with texts.'
