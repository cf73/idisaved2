            text: 'Vision is not merely optical, it is also selective. Whether conscious or unconscious, vision reflects a set of socio-cultural attitudes. These attitudes affect the ground or structure of what is seen, bringing certain concerns to the foreground while rendering others invisible. '

            text: 'This thesis investigation focuses on the relationship between marginaliza- tion as a visual concept in graphic design and the day-to-day realities of marginalized labor practices. I am keenly attentive to socio-cultural systems in which individuals are made peripheral within the power exchange.'

            text: 'Modern society’s socio-cultural structure has traditionally marginal- ized groups of people such as immigrant workers and anonymous laborers. Made peripheral by the system, the voices of these groups are hidden within the workplace: museums, factories, and schools. As a designer I do not wish to perpetuate the language of marginalization in design. I look at these established workplaces as a context from which to design and then participate in “imagining alternatives” or “radical perspectives”* that represent the margin and the center simultaneously.'

            text: 'My research methodology is built in stages. First, I seek to understand socio-cultural systems through participant observation, introspection, and dialogue(interview). Second, through strategies of re-contextualization and memorialization, I reassert the hidden voices, slipping them from the margin into full view. This re-configuration of visual language investigates modes of representation: juxtaposition, de- centering, transposition, palimpsest, and mirroring. I seek to shift the traditional hierarchies out of focus, to disturb the given array of visual facts, and generate alternative actions that reconfigure the placement of the marginal.'
