            text: 'Most of my previous work at RISD focused on data visualizations. Before this project, I was exploring and experimenting with data-driven forms and generating geometric shapes from typefaces. Even though I learned a lot from those experiences, my projects did not engage with users. With my thesis, I wish to create more participatory and interactive designs. Studying with students from many different disciplines has enabled me to learn about the power of performance and participation. In my role as activist media designer, I hope to make people not only engage with my objects, but also feel more connected to their immediate environment.'
