            text: 'When Tom started to work in the JKF studio office, in 1965, this branding project was one of the first assignments he was to get involved with. This project, under the experience direction of James Fogleman, was Tom’ first assignment, which was to design the logo for IPI with the plan to start using the symbol as the company’s center for the development of its corporate identity. The logo design prioritized identity of letters but placed within a square these parts played out subtle ideas representing the printing technology: the use of one “color” for the logo suggesting a printed form with letters reversed our in white where ink had no ink; the use of an “ink-well” at the top of the lowercase letter “i” to suggest being filled with ink; the top of the logo referencing a letterpress surface for paper to drop on.'

            text: "After this design was done\_\_its application became an integral part for IPI’s identity design. Under Jim Fogleman’s direction Tom played an integral role in the development of IPI’s identity development, which established itself over time via the applications and control of the logo design. There were many applications Tom worked, ranging from IPI’s stationary, to a variety of promotional materials, the covers for various printing ink manuals and the labels for the ink products IPI produced."

These backdrops were clearly inspired by the tutelage of his favorite faculty, Norman Ives, and his work during his recent studies at Yale.\_"
