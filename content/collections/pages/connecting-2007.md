I took Jennifer’s original email, and marked the first word stating with the letter “A” (= Apologies); then continued to look for the next word starting with “B” (= but); then the next word starting with “C” (= classes); and proceeded that way until the letter “J”, being the last word on the letter. To get the next letters I started again from the top of the email with the letter “K”— and proceeded to continue this process to loop through the letter until I found all letters and the respective words.'
