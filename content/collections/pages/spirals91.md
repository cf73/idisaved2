            text: 'This boxed set of eight books, published in 1991, contains information on the results of teaching from that period, along with a variety of other topics related to the study of graphic design at Rhode Island School of Design. The publication grew out of a need and interest to share the diverse thought and action of a rich learning experience that prepared future designers with an audience reflecting anyone interested in the subject of design or wishing to participate in our unending human search and growth. SPIRALSâ€™91 was conceived and directed by Tom Ockerse, then head of the graphic design department, and includes a number of articles authored by Tom. The book has a total of 368 pages, 21 x 29.3 cm, printed duo tone plus some pages in full color.'
