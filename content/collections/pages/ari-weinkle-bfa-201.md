            text: 'Various schools of philosophy, theology, and science suggest that which is real as existing outside of physical experience. This degree project asked: how can a designer shift the audience’s perception to that which is real, and impart a contemplative state on the viewer to cause inner realization that what is seen is part of a much larger whole? For the final part of this degree project a short animation was produced to synthe- size what was studied and explored. A symbol guide is still developing to supplement the animation.'

            text: "What is the relationship between metaphysics and design? Is there a way for design to provide an experience which goes beyond the physical? Through research, creation, and reflection, I attempted to answer these questions. Over the course of the semester, I studied a variety of different thinkers, and considered their writing academically. At the same time, I hoped to convey their thoughts on metaphysics through design. The final output of my semester is a\_“visual thesis.” Rather than having the audience need to read a dense discourse on the relationship between metaphysics and design, I attempted to visually convey the thoughts in the form of an animation.

            text: "Reality extends outside the of visual and physical phenomena immediately apparent to the individual. Within even the simplest of occurrences, the individual can become aware of the metaphysical if he/she thoughtfully observes and participates in that which is being experienced. When and if this thoughtfulness occurs, meaning and\_\_profound feeling emerge from the seemingly random perceived experience.\_\_"

            text: 'For the designer interested in imparting this feeling, the task becomes to connect the viewer with the designer’s internal insights beyond the outer, visible world. This is not achieved by creating designs that attempt to visualize the metaphysical itself. Rather, successful graphic communication, in this realm, is in itself metaphysical because of the inherent insightful truth it contains.'
