            text: 'This was a design commission by the marketing firm Nobart Design (Indianapolis, IN), which I free-lanced for while in Indiana. The project promoted the new paper line by Kimberly Clark Co., called Zodiac paper, as well as the annual Indianapolis 500 car race. The calendar was planned to start with June so it could end the year with May and the Memorial Day race. It also featured illustrators Nobart Design had used, one for each month. Not having the illustrations in hand until late in the design process, I designed a “neutral” system to accommodate the illustrations, deciding on a 12x12 inch format. This format featured the flags used in the race, each color having special significance, and also provided a means to celebrate the Zodiac colored paper. Thus, the calendar became more like a keepsake, less likely to be trashed at the end of each year.'

            text: "When the calendar opened to create a vertical structure with two squares, the top page of the spread contained the visual expression (illustrations), while the bottom contained the calendar’s information system. The first calendar spread provided the general information about the race and Nobart Design, its upper page containing a key to the flags and their meaning.\_"

            text: "Each month included a brief text that used the flags to describe symbolic values and information on the race itself. Another imposed limitation was that the calendar’s information page could only use two colors (I choose black and red) due to budget limits. Today this seems awkward since the illustration pages were not limited to colors—but in those days such limitations were often necessary. I could only hope that the two colors, black and red, would generally work out okay for the colored papers I was to use, which I also had not yet received examples of until late in the process.\_"

            text: "Since I did not have any illustrations to work with, I focused on the information page of the calendar. I decided to limit that area strictly to typographic elements, allowing the eventual illustrations to be uninhibited. While the information page was meant to remain practical (functional), I also decided to not merely repeat each page (as calendar conventions dictate) but push the layout and typography to express a degree of controlled playfulness (also supportive of the calendar’s tendency to be a decorative object in any business environment). Once I decided to use a number (vs. a name) for each month as a primary component, the rest of the elements were designed to harmonize with that letterform.\_"

            text: 'The same decision was made about the small text (plus an abstraction of the flags as a logo). Note also that the entire layout and typesetting was done by hand, with parts cut and pasted into place after receiving most of it from the typesetters in basic formats (positioning as shown being cost prohibitive, typical from that time and state of technology).'
