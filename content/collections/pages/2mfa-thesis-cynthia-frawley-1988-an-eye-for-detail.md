            text: 'Why use ornament when the bare form would suffice? This is a question which has been the conundrum of ornament ever since the modern era ushered in its proscription against it. Historically, ornament has been an integral part of all cultures. From Paleolithic cave paintings to Victorian fenestration to Post-Modern classicism, people of every society have transformed the useful into the beautiful by giving importance and meaning to otherwise plain surfaces.'

            text: 'However, ornament is more than aesthetically pleasing. It serves a function by reflecting the tastes, values, fears, and aspirations of an age. Ornament can be a means of controlling one''s environment. It satisfies the need for identification, orientation, scale, rhythm, and sometimes whimsy. The visual diversity supplied by ornamented architecture and design can reveal distinctions of time and place. It is a true expression of human nature.'

            text: 'The investigations of this thesis explore the role of ornament in the design process. A varied vocabulary of design techniques has been utilized to examine the criteria for the creation of successful ornament. Unity of form only can be achieved by the careful selection and arrangement of the parts. Small subtle details that add character and blend in make for a more effective and unified statement.'

            text: 'The conclusion of this thesis explores the problems of contemporary design. The referential qualities of ornament can be a means of reducing the bland conformity of present day design. By acquiring an eye for detail a designer can achieve a sense of context and give his or her work meaning and character.'
