            text: 'Researchers believe that the modern individual is soft wired for sociability, attachment, affection, and companionship instead of aggression, violence, self-interest, and utilitarianism as was previously believed. Researchers also believe that the modern environment, including not only the urban landscape and infrastructure, but also the educational, corporate, and government systems, limits our capacity to fully develop our empathic capabilities.'

            text: 'For the past two and a half years, I have immersed myself inside a community of students, educators, and practitioners engaged in the art of hands-on making. Based on this experience, I have developed a hypothesis around the idea that making with physical materials greatly aides in the development of our empathic capabilities. In light of this hypothesis, I have come to believe that the personal computer, as an instrument that allows us to make with conceptual materials, is woefully ill-designed to afford the same benefit.'
