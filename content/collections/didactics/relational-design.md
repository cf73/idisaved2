            text: "explores visual communication needs and design responsibility for human experiences in a changing social environment. The premise shows that designed objects function in a vast range of possible relationships that pattern and shape identity, information, and behavior. Projects are very hands-on to explore the interrelationships among form, function, meaning, and audience. Responding to the growing world paradigm of collaboration and integrative thinking we must experience group dynamics, consider how new media can serve social and information needs, explore ways to solve problems, and stimulate imagination and innovation.\_"
