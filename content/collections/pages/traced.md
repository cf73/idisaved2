The selection of fragments “traced” is always done by some systemic technique, to serve the purpose of removing our “subjective” tendencies as true creators of poetry and art. The systemic manner as a means for making selections includes “chance” to operate and interact with the existing time/space object. The most important aspect in this act of selection involves the maker to remain “objective” versus letting the common “subjective” tendencies toward “preferences” guide that process."

To reveal understanding. Thus, so-called “chance juxtapositions” of parts and wholes unfolded original means to interpret and fresh insight.'
