Not in the demeaning sense of that word but in its most noble sense like those who practice healing. I imagine that this notion immediately offends many designers, or aspiring designers. After all, not many want to be a “servant” to anyone. It may also suggest a return to the objective, impersonal mode of “modernism” which robe has been undone over the last decades via post-modernism, and the ....'

            text: "1) The designer was commissioned to design a poster announcing a symposium for architects. Understanding that the conference centered on questions posed by post-modernists to provide a provocative discussion among the most avant-garde practitioners of that time and others, the designer responded accordingly. A central aspect of the poster was the title as a typographic configuration that reflected the ideas superimposed on a photographic image. The commissioner of this poster, a cutting-edge architect and primary instigator of this event, took offence at the poster and the title in particular. Simply analyzed, it did not fit his idea of a conventional poster, expecting the title large and straight forward at the top, the image in the middle, and text details at the bottom. The designer (amused by the irony of that person’s inability to shift his unconventional views for architect to that of the conventional poster) was able to make him appreciate that this design provided a necessary interface as a dialogue (in the true sense of that word, wherein the various contributions in it helped bring to light the essence of something) about the event. Appreciation turned to praise.\_"

            text: "2) A magazine designer once used a photograph (of three men) upside down in a spread. The publisher threw a fit, arguing that this was disrespectful to the photographer and that he would not want to reader to have to turn the magazine upside down. The designer tried his best to explain the reasoning behind this but could not convince the publisher\_\_and it was decided to table the decision until another time. A week later the publisher happened to call the designer, to ask him how he liked his decision to change the title references to the articles in the magazine on the contents page. Totally enamored by his creative act the publisher proceeded to explain that the magazine had a responsibility for helping others see the world in a different way, and not to feel restricted by conventionalism. When the designer matched that idea with the photographic action, the publisher\_\_promised to look at it again. After a more didactic illustration of the significance of this upside-down photograph in relation to other components and the whole idea of the magazine the publisher\_agreed to accept this decision. Not only that, having understood fully the deeper significance of this and its implications, he became a enthusiastic advocate if the act and would not have accepted otherwise.\_"

They usually draw us into the arena of social activism. That seems only a narrow view in that it reflects more the specific notion of responsibility — not necessarily the heart of it. Although working in relationship to tasks that draw us into the activist arena, in which we tend to come face to face with what matters to people and things and what it means to be human the tendency remains too much for us to look outward, and not enough inward. In fact, it is not unlikely that the individual working on such an activist project is made to feel good about this “altruistic” activity — only to become egocentric and offensive the next moment toward another.\_"

We cannot know unless we realize other things, what you are not, as the known. Furthermore, when we come to know things we know them by virtue of their inter-relatedness to other things, and to ourselves. Things simply cannot exist, and therefore cannot have meaning, unless we perceive them and understand them in terms of their relatedness to other things. Knowledge, then, constitutes the result of a process in which our phenomenal world of things and their activities among each other, act as mediators: to each other and to ourselves. Knowing is to link the external to the internal.\_"

The Interpretant factor as the\_root\_of thought and the root of meaning is the key to his model and sets Peirce apart from the linguists.

Eastern thought held this perspective for ages, and all that is available to us from ancient wisdom (no matter what part of our world) utilizes the same principles. Yet, one major aspect stands out in Eastern observation: the relation of the knower to All, whatever we may choose to call it, Cosmos, Life, God, or that which is the One, the Real, the Eternal. This consideration reflects our possible range or levels of conscious capacities, from low to high, from our so-called physical world to the more unseen world of emotions and thought and to the even more intangible world of what we call the spirit or soul. Thus, from the concrete to the abstract, from matter to spirit, from Form to Life.\_\_"

How we each look at our world is through these colored spectacles of inner knowledge. Everything we become conscious of is then colored by viewing our world through the spectacles that are ourselves. Still, we are part of a larger whole.\_"

The sender (as knower) of these thoughts and ideas must therefore find a way to knowingly express and manifest his known, so that the form can potentially become mediated by the user to reveal its intended purpose.

But there is a problem: how can we assure the kind of mediation that results in the certain knowledge in the consciousness of the user that it was designed for, when the world that we live in is so elusive and so open to interpretation? The answer is simple: we can never be certain, but the designer hopes to bring together in some harmonic play those things that are essential to the various levels of vibration that direct a consciousness toward a certain orientation and special significance. I use the word vibration for that is the method of access – light is vibration, sound is vibration, music is vibration, color is vibration. Remember physics class and the concept of wavelength – wavelength is vibration."

The design process must, after all, incorporate or prepare for all sign potentials that the product was designed to serve. No product is merely one sign, but a system of signs, and, as stated before, mediated by other signs. Therefore, to design is to require thought about relations in a special way. This is where society truly depends on the expertise of designers:\_to help establish and connect relations minimizing ambiguities and vagueness. Professional expertise, then, requires designers not only to have skill in forming expressions, but to know clearly\_why\_designers serve, and how and who they serve."

They thereby help make our world the perfect environment in which we can live with all our aspiration for perfection.\_But\_beauty of form is limited\_if\_it can only serve the purpose of form and our phenomenal world of form. And craft and technical expertise is equally limited if it only serves that singular purpose of production. Moreover, form for form-sake is dangerously seductive since it can so easily make us believe, by virtue of its concrete realism that it must be ‘meaningful.’ Finally, form as the result of designers’ self-serving ideals illuminates a deception. We find so much of this today, with designers eager to develop stylistic forms as if they were merely speaking to other designers. This only confuses, distracts, and misdirects a deceived user!"

We must learn to strive for such ideals in action and evolution, and not work for the products we will produce.
