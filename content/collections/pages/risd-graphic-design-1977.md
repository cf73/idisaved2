            text: "The Graphic Design Department at RISD organized an exhibition of student work in 1967. The exhibit intended to share the department’s vision of the relatively new field of graphic design at that time, and publicly share how the department's curriculum prepared students for this practice. Having collected an immense amount of information about the substance of this curriculum's pedagogy Tom decided it was worth sharing in this booklet that documents the works in the exhibition. Most importantly, the booklet also shared the department’s vision for this new field of practice, and it allowed for a national and international distribution. The local printer that was most used by RISD its graphic design faculty, Foremost Printing, granted funding for this publication."
