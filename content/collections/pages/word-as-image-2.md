We can label this as CONCRETE POETRY.'

            text: 'Concrete poetry stemmed partly from an interest to combine minimalism in art with literary forms of experimental poetry. It evolved into a world-wide movement from the 1960s through the early 1980s—and caught my interest around 1965 after I had met the artist Dieter Roth (who was listed as a cornet poet among other labels).'

The Hnasjorg Mayer version does add certain aspects the other version does not have, but does help the reader expand information or does it "direct" meaning in a certain way and limit content? This is reflective of the challenge with typography for designers!'

The version off the left was hers—printed on letterpress at Indiana University; the one on the right was another version by Hansjorg Mayer,  translated in his "style" and use of typography.  By the way, I first taught at Indiana University in 1967 (until 1972, when I came to RISD). There I met Mary Ellen, as  a faculty member at the University, and student of mine in my typography courses. We became good friends and inspired each other on our separate discoveries and interpretations of concrete. We have memorable discussions on issue I have to share with you as well; and we both appreciated how we learned from each other. Also, Mary Ellen was able to bring a variety of concrete poets from all over the world toBloomington, Indiana, in this place that had meanwhile become a hot center who would for concrete poetry. She eventually published a major source called '
