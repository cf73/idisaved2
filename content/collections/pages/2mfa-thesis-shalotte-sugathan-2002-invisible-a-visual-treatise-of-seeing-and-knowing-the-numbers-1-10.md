            text: 'We are introduced to numbers through mathematics and taught to make only quantitative associations with them. It is, therefore, natural for us to be grasp their calculative dynamism but turn a blind-eye to the inherent simplicity, purity and elegance of their abstracted characters. '

            text: 'Using present number figures (1,2,3...) and number words (in English - one, two, three...) this thesis investigates possibilities to bring to a visual consciousness the metaphysical phenomena of an unconscious numerical knowing. It demystifies the hidden exquisite structure of numbers and unravels glimpses of an inner beauty (nature) to communicate a qualitative sense of a numerical experience — thus, visually explaining how 5 can mean ''fiveness'' besides being merely five things.'
