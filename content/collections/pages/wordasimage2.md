            text: 'The visual language plays a critical role in what we create as graphic designers—and this “gestalt” view (or the unity of parts operating in wholes) indicates that designers of interfaces for communication must have an understanding of users in mind. However, the gestalt principles, while playing a dynamic role of complexity, as abstractions for principles are of an “underlying” and “hidden” nature—which makes this a slippery challenge to use them consciously. Also, since perception represent what we construct in our minds, as the mind seeks to organize and discriminate unraveling the relative complexities. is significant.'
