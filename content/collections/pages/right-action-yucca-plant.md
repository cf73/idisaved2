            text: "Over the weeks this idea unfolded itself. First, I decided to take pictures of the plant, on slide film,\Land to project these slides along with texts from the Mahatma letters. I decided to take a portrait of each leaf on the Yucca plant, making a single image of each leaf from a certain point of view. Also, I decided to approach this according to a simple spiral system, by photographing first the leaf at the lowest, ground-level, then moving to the next one by moving around the plant in a spiral, and from the lowest level to its highest.\_\_"

To show these slides I decided to use a dissolve unit to make their transitions smooth and metamorphic, and got my daughter to send a dissolve unit from our school.\_\_"

            text: "This needed music and I had in mind something or other by the composer Arvo Part – sort of classic yet contemporary. I bought two CDs at the local store, where I listened briefly to one piece that seemed just perfect. Its title was Litany, which is Christian, – not so appropriate for the Mahatma topic, but I thought it was sung in a foreign language and that no-one could understand the words anyway. Back at the house I played the whole thing, but my excitement turned into disappointment when I discovered that the words were in English and made a definite Christian reference.\_"

            text: "That night I woke up with the notion to count how many leaves from the Yucca plant I had documented portraits of, since this plus the same number of slides from the book would determine the structure, and therefore the length of music. I got up and counted…to discover the amazing fact that there were 49 leaves on the plan!\LTheosophists especially recognize this number as the auspicious number mentioned in various references in the Mahatma letters and other theosophic writings, being 7 x 7, and referring among other things to the seven fields and levels of consciousness and their seven sub-fields respectively. The next day I simply put the images in the order of how I shot the plant, and the less structured slides I shot from the pages of letters and played it with the dissolve unit set on automatic with its timer for 6 seconds per slide. The whole performance was 13 minutes and about 19 seconds.\_"

            text: "Back to the music. I again consulted the various CDs I had borrowed,\Land this happened to bring me back to the Schubert piece mentioned earlier,\Lthe Adagio from his String Quintet in C. Not only did none of the possible options come close to the timing, . . . the Schubert piece was exactly. . . 13 minutes and 19 seconds! So, I played the music with the slides, albeit somewhat reluctantly. This time, however, instead of the piece reminding me of my aunt’s funeral I recognized the music I had so often heard her play when she practiced her violin, which was a special and happy memory indeed. Clearly, this piece was the right music, in every way, as you will also experience!\_"

            text: "Curiously this project also contains three symbolic qualities in the material used: Firsts, the 49 images from the Yucca plant that refer to our human nature in the physical, emotional and spiritual fields of consciousness. Secondly, the 49 slides of texts, words that reflect the mental world and the mind. And thirdly, the music, which forms a synthesis of 49 parts in time, and as “sound” it can represent the invisible field of the Spirit. We also know that the mind links the worlds of form and spirit.\_\_"
