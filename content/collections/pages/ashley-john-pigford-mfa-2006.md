            text: 'As an artist, designer and musician I am interested in how to create audio- visual experiences that are spawned from my understanding, ability and inspiration from music. Within music (in both performing and listening) I feel connected to something implicit to my being and I desire to share this through the work that I create. By considering music as a metaphor for design I look at the structure of musical composition as a method to create visual form. It is my own methodology that is interesting to me, with the final result existing as an artifact of the process.'

            text: 'My thesis, this thesis, is about the relationship between (or metaphor of) musical process and design composition. Within this study is the analysis of music in terms of fundamental rhythm (the beat structure based on tempo), melody, harmony and overall gestalt in relation to the corresponding elements of design. Overall this thesis looks to the creation and composition of music as a methodology of design composition.'

            text: 'As a designer I have always been plagued with where to start. What is the initial action toward a goal? Yet when I am in music there is no question – I can make a song off of any note I play. I pick up any instrument and it inspires me to find a note - a vibration - then other notes to accompany it. I build relationships of sound organized in a temporal structure, which makes a song. But how does this translate into the visual world? What can I learn from my making music that can affect my visual work?'

            text: 'I believe that what designers can learn from music is how to unlock, or tap into, the inner- ness of things and allow this logic to pervade their work and process. Music requires a quietness of the mind and an opening of the soul. Sound penetrates so deeply into our beings and fulfills a deeply implicit role in our consciousness.'

            text: 'At the core of life is vibration – movement, motion, rhythm – things put into action with reciprocal effects that emanate out from the source like the theoretical Big Bang that created our universe and everything that we call ‘reality’. Every action has a source, a point of origin, something that is the first thing of a series of events that add up to something greater than the sum of its constituent parts. For a designer this is traditionally considered ‘the'

            text: 'As a musician this is my process: to start simply by playing a note and hearing where the song takes me. My goal for graduate school is to utilize this process to develop an artistic method for myself. My thesis will consist of documentation of my work that embodies this methodology (in progress) and explains my ideas and realizations in a didactic format.'
