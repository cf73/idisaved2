With art and sports as two favorite interests he went to Ohio State University on a full athletic scholarship (recruited by the swim coach Mike Peppe) to study commercial art. After receiving his BFA in 1963, he continued studies in graphic design at Yale University, earning his MFA in 1965. His design career began at Fogelman Associates (Morristown, NJ), where he worked under the direction of Jim Fogelman (considered by Philip B. Meggs to be the originator of “corporate identity design” in America) on design accounts for Ciba, Hoffman LaRoche, Interchem, Syntex and others. Although Ockerse made a career shift to teaching in 1967, he has continued his design practice, providing communication and design strategies for clients such as Houghton Mifflin, Indiana University, RISD, RIHT Financial, Apple Computer,\_"

During this transformative period his students provoked him to radically rethink education, the practice of design and the world of art. He became deeply involved in the growing 1960s activities of concrete poetry, Fluxus, mail art, happenings, book arts and other “intermedia” arts (op. cit. Dick Higgins) – all seeking to erase conventional boundaries and merge the arts. This made him realize the importance of the human factor at the very heart of design and that all design is truly a matter of human “interface design” (a term the computing industry subsequently hijacked), which means to design for the user, creating something worth experiencing for both practical and inspirational purposes.\_"

To quote his 2006 lecture at Hong Ik University, Korea: “I view design not merely as ‘making’– rather, as ‘making appear.’ My interests are in attending to a process that can generate visual design required to help bring about relationships. This embraces the growing paradigm shift from the reductive to the holistic. In this shift relationships are contextually sensitive and able to integrate the dynamic networks of mind, form, sensibility and spirit with life and nature’s energies. Similarly, my quest in education seeks to offer what will truly sustain students in life: processes to help cultivate their intelligence so as to become truly integrated individuals in order to deal with life as a whole. For design/art education this means a shift from technical, skill-oriented, analytical (intellectual) tendencies toward ways that deepen awareness for how user experiences can serve practical needs but also draw out the poetry of life we are all so intimately part of.”\_"

            text: "Ockerse is known for bringing to light methods for perceiving the mechanisms of meaning in visual communication design. This interest was first stimulated by his experiments in concrete poetry with what he called “word and image equations.” He was subsequently drawn into semiotics as an intellectual theory that deals with questions concerning meaning, cognition, reference, truth and reality, which he developed into a tool based on the principles developed by logician C. S. Peirce. Eventually these connected his interests with other fields for knowing, which helped him delve deeper into the subtle qualities reflected by mind and being – keynotes to discovering the essential nature of objects and what lies beneath the unfolding/enfolding experience of the design process. Ockerse has lectured on these interests and written articles such as\_"
