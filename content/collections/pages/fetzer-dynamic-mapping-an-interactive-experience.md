            text: "— a question vital to the efforts of a Fetzer Institute sponsored group called The Collective Wisdom Initiative.\_Although the design task appeared simply a matter of taking the group’s research (published in a small booklet) and mapping it out in some graphic form, the task became more challenging. The design team envisioned not merely an informational system but asked itself how this “field” and its inherent magnetism could become “mapped” to enable the viewer to engage with something directly reflective to that information.\_"

            text: 'The protein quality of consciousness made it necessary to think of a new way to look at the interface as experience. Most interfaces are didactic and linear in design and function because their goal is to disseminate information to the user in a convenient manner. This practical approach is quite suitable for many types of content, but when content is of a social or experiential nature this type of methodology does not work.'

            text: "The design team considered the perceptual engagement with words and images as a “poetic” partnership, a gentle co-motion in time and space to stimulate a deep sense of consciousness — of imagination, broadened perspective, and heightened meaning. Poetics offers the user vitality via the power of grace. Grace invites a suspension of the ego, permitting receptivity and inspiration (being in spirit). From that unfolds the energy of awareness, of intelligence and the feeling of abundance.\_"

            text: "The design is a non-hierarchical, non-linear structure — of center-points in which each “cell” is an organized principle that acts as both microcosm and macrocosm. This holistic conception applies to the entire design interface language, from its largest structure to the smallest component. Interaction is with objects in constant flux. Links are programmed to randomize the parts along with a few controls, so the viewer discovers new and unexpected relationships. That dynamism empowers the participant with possibilities and co-creation. In paying attention there is the possibility of surprise, which stimulates spontaneity and play. Every experience therefore enables fresh insights. The key is to participate with a contemplative attitude, leaving out expectations, and letting happen whatever happens.\_"
