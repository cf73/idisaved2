        text: "A system is an abstraction of identifiable patterns that relates parts to a whole as a certain way of looking at an object.\_This view can compare to the nature of language as the grammar of parts and how they operate in the whole. As the philosopher Charles Morris once said:\_"

        text: ". As such this basic human desire to organize, order, and seek harmony in wholeness, pattern seeking reveals a natural phenomenon for the mechanisms of mind. Perception and thinking reflect the relational phenomena that are essential to the search for meaning since without relationship meaning is not possible. The more we become aware of relationship the more we come to understand.\_\_Hence this becomes the basis for design."

        text: "Systems as integrated wholes feed back relational values to each of its segments that would otherwise not exist. Quantum physicist David Bohm referred to this principle of wholeness as the implicate order found throughout our universe. Its complexity translates into a sense of beauty, or awe, if you will. Thus, a system is a total working unit that feeds back relational values that would not otherwise exist to each of its segments—the whole being much more than the sum of its parts.\_\_"

        text: "In summary, systems thinking exists as a fundamental principle for all we do. While that may seem to instill in us some apprehension in appearing as a constraint, the truth that understanding the nature and possibilities of systems gives humanity a very liberating tool, becomes a way of looking at something that in return is also a way that tells us something, which can therefore influence and change one’s point of view.\_"
