        text: 'The name IDI stands for InciteDesignInsight, a comprehensive website that presents an archive of visual communication design work. The site is an archive of work as the results from various endeavors developed and experienced by Tom Ockerse since he started his design practice, experimental work in 1965, follow also by his teaching of design starting in 1967. IDI presents this broad scope of these relational endeavors under five major topics representing the range from the practical to theoretical. Due to the vast amount of work to become archived this site will continually be updated as more of the work becomes available. The site will also expand to share related works by those who collaborated with Tom.'
