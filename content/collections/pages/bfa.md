            text: "The Senior BFA Degree Project is an independent project in graphic design studies that requires the student to develop a body work in consultation with a faculty advisor, culminating in a finished product. Also, the\_BFA Degree Project\_is a final course and project requirement for students to complete their RISD undergraduate education. However, it is important for each student to view the\_BFA Degree Project not as an “end”; rather,\_as a BEGINNING: an opportunity to develop a personal line of inquiry toward becoming a graphic designer.\_"

            text: "The\_BFA Degree Project,\_defined by the student, reflects the individual’s interest in voice and practice. Like any good investigation, as students have seen so far in the design curriculum, the\_BFA Degree Project\_should be guided by questions. The goal of the\_BFA Degree Project\_is not a set of answers to those questions, but more a synthesis of the design inquiry through experimentation and articulation. Other rubrics — like theory, craft, and audience — are also important, depending on the project.\_"

            text: "While the bulk of work occurs usually during the final (spring) semester, planning for a\_BFA Degree Project\_starts in the Fall, if not before, with a\_BFA Degree Project\_proposal due at the end of the semester. This is a chance to begin an internal conversation, along with faculty, peers and others. The BFA Degree Project should be as enjoyable as it is educational.\_"
