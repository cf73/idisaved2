            text: 'Tom had been invited as a 6-week visiting lecturer and critic at the Hull College of Higher Education, Hull, England, as well as being a consultant on curriculum for design programs. During this 6-week period the Ferens Art Gallery exhibited Tomâ€™s work for which he designed this poster. The poster (low budget, limited to a one-color, black) was designed to express the principles of design embedded in the process, for which Tom used his notes to plan the exhibit intended as a narrative for the audience to experience. Being a guest at Hull College Tom planned out the exhibit on an available classroom blackboard with white chalk. This literally became the means to present the exhibit for the Ferens Art Gallery.'
