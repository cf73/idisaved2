            text: 'Vernacular is the native language of a particular locale. Too often, negative connotations of the word pervade our thoughts. This is especially evident within design, where designers often devalue these objects because they are produced outside the profession, indicating a degree of separation between “us” and “them”. This characterization leads to defining the quality of an item as high or low. Objects are viewed by style rather than content. '

            text: 'Vernacular communicates directly to its surrounding community. It is a solution which brings an immediate need. In spite of any criticism, the form serves its purpose as a language — a language from within a community. Since not all designers come from within such a community, they must carefully consider context, intention and audience.'
