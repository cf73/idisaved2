            text: ' is a 32-page booklet, published in 1977, that documents a department exhibition of the newly developed Graphic Design Department program at the Rhode Island School of Design. The program and results of teaching had already become a design curriculum model for other schools at that time, which was then furthered by the booklet’s public distribution due to its articulate content as an aid for others to plan such programs. The booklet was based on an exhibition of student work in November 1976 at RISD’s Woods-Gerry gallery. In the main text Tom Ockerse (then head of the department and instrumental in developing the new program after he arrived at RISD in 1971) described the department’s curriculum philosophy to prepare students to practice after school in a still young and developing profession. Size: 21.5 cm x 28 cm; 32 pages, 2 colors, printed on Mohawk Superfine paper.'

            text: "This booklet documents the 1976 exhibition of the RISD Graphic Design Department’s BFA degree program. The exhibition itself was meant as a didactic statement on the department’s philosophy and how its newly established curriculum looked to achieve this.\_By this time the department had achieved national notoriety on defining the still young practice of graphic design and how to prepare students for this practice.\_Once\_the booklet was distributed nationally and internationally, it proved of great value to help other schools develop their programs. Thereby it also helped raise the standards of design pedagogy. This outline of the RISD Graphic Design Department’s curriculum remained the underlining standards for future years as it continued to grow and progress.\_"
