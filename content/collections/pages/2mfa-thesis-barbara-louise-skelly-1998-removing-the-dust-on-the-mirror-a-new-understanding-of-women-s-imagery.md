            text: 'graphic designer makes is for the purpose of communicating something to someone. All images have layers of meaning. Their meaning also varies with each individual''s perception and interpretation of what is seen. This makes them difficult to analyze. What becomes clear is the objective for use of certain types of images, and how these images trigger certain biological, psychological and spiritual reactions in human beings. These findings are presented on the pages of this thesis document. '

            text: 'Based on this I have concluded that our cultural imagery conveys perverse sexual ideology which is then used to manipulate the general public on physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual levels. This assault is most evident where money is involved. Sex and violence are used to sell everything including personal identity. The problem with this scenario is that sex and violence become linked in both the communication and the expectation. This raises the question of what kind of environment is being created by such messages. It also introduces the image maker as myth maker who is therefore, at least partially responsible for the stories those images tell. Rather than argue or try to prove the destructive nature of current cultural imagery, I offer my personal alternative to such imagery in my final thesis project: The Witch In The Wood. My goal is to inspire others to new heights. The intention is to raise hearts and minds to nurture our ability to become fully humane.'
