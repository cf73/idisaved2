            text: 'As people face different situations which produce different feelings, needs, and desires, language is shaped with different forms serving different functions. The way that one can recognize and analyze the variety of functions that language fulfills in society is to analyze and to understand the hidden structure of its communication. '

            text: 'Studies concerning the hidden structure of language can best be examined through the theory of the linguist, Roman Jakobson who was the most celebrated figure of the Prague school of European structural linguistics. Jakobson broke language function into the following: the cognitive or referential function of language operates when it is used for the transmission of information; the expressive or emotive function is seen when language is used to indicate the mood or attitude of the speaker, or the writer; the connotative or injunctive function is involved when it is used to influence the person to whom it is addressed, and there are also phatic and metalingual function.'
