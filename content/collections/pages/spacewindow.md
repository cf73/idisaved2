            text: "\_in Newport, RI. This church was bought by an individual who then let Tom and his students from a RISD class use this space as a source to stimulate bookworks with. For his own project Tom photographed parts inside the church that represented some systemic nature to reflect the idea of prayer, which was also stimulated by the Lord’s Prayer that was hand lettered on one wall. He used each word in the Prayer, left out the repetitive ones, leaving him with 44 words that determined making a set of 44 cards. Each card had one of the images on one side. Then each image had a hole punched out to serve like an asterisk to the repetitive part in the image, followed by one of a word next to the hole on the other side of the card. In 1977 TOE published this set of 44 cards as a limited edition of 300 numbered copies, 10 x 14.5 cm, printed offset in black on white stock with hole punched out to relate front and back of each card.\_"
