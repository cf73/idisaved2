            text: 'This boxed set of eight books, published in 1991, contains information on the results of teaching from that period, along with a variety of other topics related to the study of graphic design at Rhode Island School of Design. The publication grew out of a need and interest to share the diverse thought and action of a rich learning experience that prepared future designers with an audience reflecting anyone interested in the subject of design or wishing to participate in our unending human search and growth. SPIRALS’91 was conceived and directed by Tom Ockerse, then head of the graphic design department, and includes a number of articles authored by Tom. The book has a total of 368 pages, 21 x 29.3 cm, printed duo tone plus some pages in full color.'
