            text: "This is an original bookwork, titled “universal/Unique,” was made for Tom's contribution to the 1988 exhibit at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA. The bookwork's two (front and back) press sheets were hung on the wall with the bound version hanging hung between them. The work uses concretism as a principle means to re-present the ideas that unfolded based on the exhibit’s theme and the creative process for this work itself. Afterwards a limited edition of 250 numbered copies was published, the bookwork having 32 pages of 18 x 18cm, printed offset on Mohawk Superfine paper.\_"
