            text: "The theory of CONCRETISM encourages the study of objects as dynamic systems for a depth of meaning and relational values revealing an inner world, considered “abstract” because invisible, that unfolds a\_network of relationships and values as a world of ONENESS, opposite\_to the ordinary sense of “reality” in the world of appearances.\_"

            text: "In other words, this theory of inquiry overturns the generalized notion that\_the world around us is “real” and “concrete,” and designates the inner, intangible world as “abstract” by realizing that the hidden networking begins to reflect relationships of underlying principals directing values and meaning far beyond the limited factor of appearances and into a unity of wholeness or: Oneness. That unity of Oneness reveals the true “Concrete” world with a capital “C” for a true sense of Reality with a capital “R”!\_"

            text: 'Examples of this are discovering sacred geometry as the underlying principle for good form, learning the inner “character” of a person and a true sense of identity with that individual, and gaining a sense of awe and wonder when brought into a relationship with a huge tree. In this sense, we perceive relationships as these, extracted from that deep sense of wholeness, from that REALITY, from that CONCRETE Reality, to derive a sense of true Poetic Essence, a knowing that is powerful, dynamic, and a truly living sense of CONCRETISM.'
