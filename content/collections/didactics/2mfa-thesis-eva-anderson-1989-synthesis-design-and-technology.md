            text: 'Since the 1970s, and especially in the late 80s, A Call has been made by many leading designers, design historians and academicians for the design community to take on the challenge of designing in a socially and environ mentally conscious manner. Many designers fulfill this responsibility by dedicating their skills and a percentage of their time to producing pro-bono work. A few more go so far as to weed out clients and reject design projects they feel are morally reprehensible.'

            text: "With the prevailing problems of solid waste, ozone depletion, acid rain, toxins leaching into our groundwater from landfills, and timberlands being stripped and improperly managed, the graphic design profession will soon have to include the word eco-impact (impact on ecology) in the design process. In addition to fulfilling the clients requirements of quality at a reasonable price, graphic designers will have to consider new factors such as: what happens to the end product when it is disposed of; what kinds of paper and inks are safest when decomposing or incinerated; what kinds of papers are recyclable; what\_alternative communications mediums are available so that solid waste is reduced; what can be incorporated into the design so that public awareness is increased, while at the same time, the client's message is conveyed."

            text: 'Selection of materials, such s paper, is one aspect of â€¢ design project in which the designer has most control, typically limited only by client budget. As the majority of designers'' projects are produced on paper, recycled paper is the focus of this thesis for an examination of what roles and actions a socially and environmentally conscious graphic designer might take. Designers are in a unique position as they not only physically produce a pro-design product. but synthesize information and solve problems in the process of design. These skills can help relieve our environmental problems. By becoming aware of the issues and facts, and by informing themselves of alternative materials and methods, designers can inform, persuade and direct their clients towards environmentally sound decisions.'
