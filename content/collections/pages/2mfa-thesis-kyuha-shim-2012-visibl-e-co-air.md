            text: 'Most of my previous works at RISD focused on data visualizations. Before this project, I was exploring and experimenting with data-driven forms, and generating geometric shapes from typefaces. Even though I learned a lot from those experiences, my projects did not engage with users. With my thesis, I created more participatory and interactive designs. Studying with students from many different disciplines enabled me to learn about the power of performance and participation. In my role as activist media designer, I hope to make people not only engage with my pieces objects, but also feel more connected to their immediate environment.'
