            text: 'A graphic interpretation of the history of numbers was originally designed to accompany the article by Ramon Cardenas, published in the 1971 issue of the quarterly magazine by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. The image for the article caused a demand for extra copies; and when none were left PMM decided to publish a poster version of it.'
