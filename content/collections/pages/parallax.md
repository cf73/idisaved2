        text: "We assume that facts are singular and identifiable as frozen entities. Yet, whatever singularity we perceive that appearance is false because all identity implicates the principle of mediation. In other words, perception depends on a process wherein a part cannot escape its relational web of complexity. This suggests also that everything exists as a narrative, a story being a collection of parts operating in parallax to serve a larger whole.\_"

Once the basic idea to communicate is determined, representations for that idea can be expressed as a short narrative diachronically in three to five steps. That is followed by an inquiry of expressive options that represent parts of the idea from different points-of-view synchronically. This diachronic/synchronic matrix then becomes a system to select parts that serve as parallax views to express that idea. The narrative for that idea can be configured an a variety of waysâ€”sequenced in time or as a single unit."
