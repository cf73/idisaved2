            text: 'Graphic design education - a mouthful for an even larger and diverse field. Each one of us individually tries to understand what it all means by making certain connections that give us the means to understand the act and the action. The variables that the field tries to address collectively are boggling. Can there be any agreement in such a situation to begin to provide a common frame of reference? If so, can a system be created to begin a meaningful collective discourse to enhance understanding?'

            text: 'This thesis tries to approach this issue by addressing the reoccurring themes that become components of all educational experiences. It does not try to tackle the diversity of opinions on the subject, but recognizes them at the outset. Schools do not exist in vacuums. They are in essence significant structures that enhance and delineate experiences that schools as institutions consider valuable. These decisions are affected by the context in which they exist, which begins to affect the structure, direction and most important what a particular school interprets as viable experiences in (graphic) design.'

            text: 'The first part of the thesis begins to ask fundamental questions of educating and training, and form and structure of education. It then delves into three unique historical contexts in the development of graphic design education. The VKhUTIMAS, the Bauhaus and Hochschule fur Gestaltung (ULM) were three unique schools that not only addressed their own particular contexts, but tried to expand and understand the visual arts at all levels. They are discussed both in pedagogic and historical terms to show the proximity of schools and the context in which they exist in.'

            text: 'The context may be different, but the structure of educational experiences are the same. Contextual education, even though it recognizes the diversity of education as a weaving together of constituent parts (whatever they may be) to make a whole (education as supersign- a complex number of signs that function together in unity.). It also recognizes that there are basic educational components that structure educational experiences. '

            text: 'These can be categorized as: The Philosophy- a creed or value system that mediates the perceptions of, in this case, graphic design. The Curriculum- structures that order a set of viable experiences to achieve goals and objectives. The Taxonomy- a system for understanding how educational experiences work from the vantage point of structuring information, how we perceive it and act on it. The core of this thesis goes into detail to map out the interactive and complex “fugue” between the constituent elements. It avoids questions of value as it is a fluid decision based on context. What it does try to do is tackle what in essence is an abstraction by trying to make it visible and in doing so increase the awareness of both the individual educator and the field. In the end, we empower ourselves to better understand the educational process.'
