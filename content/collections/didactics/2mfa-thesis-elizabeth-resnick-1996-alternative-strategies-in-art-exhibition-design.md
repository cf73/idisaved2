            text: 'An exhibition is essentially a temporal-spatial installation of cultural artifacts. These artifacts are often linked by a narrative structure. However, the narrative does not always satisfactorily explain the reason why certain objects are brought together. For this reason I believe the spatial context in which the artifacts are displayed to be as significant in conveying meaning as the artifacts themselves. As such, this type of installation can evoke a cultural discourse achieving an aesthetic or political goal, while disseminating information and knowledge on its subject.'

            text: 'My thesis examines the formal, expressive, and didactic strategies used to convey the meaning of the artifacts in an exhibition. My goal is to design an exhibition that immerses the viewer in an active space that reveals and provokes, but also informs and educates. '

            text: 'To accomplish this goal, I have selected as my subject an investigation of the innovative ideas and mass communication strategies used by the historical Avant-Garde movements of Futurism, Dada, and Constructivism. Further I will present evidence of the legacy of these ideas and strategies where it exists in American art and communications design of the 1980s and 1990s.'
