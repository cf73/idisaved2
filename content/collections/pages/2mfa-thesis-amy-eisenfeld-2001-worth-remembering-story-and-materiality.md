            text: 'This thesis explores the relationship between story and materials. The stories I am interested in are those that document life events, because one small story can offer insight into a universal experience. Central to my exploration is the role materials can play in telling such stories: how documented and physical evidences of the past lend truth to the story, and how physically touched forms provide insight into the layers and multiplicity of life.

            text: 'My experiments with book forms and creative writing have included materials such as: cardboard, plastic tubes, rubber, granite, interfacing, gauze, sandpaper, screen, foam, extension cords, and spaghetti. The stories and materials are woven together to create meaning that is digested through the hands as well as the head.'
