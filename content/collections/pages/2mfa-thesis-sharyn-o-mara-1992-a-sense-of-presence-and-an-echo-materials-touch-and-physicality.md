            text: 'Communication not communicating. In this world of complex and competing interests, few messages actually break through to a viewer who is likely to be in the throes of visual overload, more anxious for a visual vacation than increased saturation. We simply cannot respond to everything before us; we can delight in but a few choice pieces. Those few pieces that do stand apart from the rest, those that do make contact, embody a unique quality. '

            text: "What is the nature of those qualities which break through the visual sameness from which we suffer? It investigates what it is about certain materials and forms—in direct relation to the message—that engage people, that cause them to interrupt their paths and take a critical moment to consider, process, and think. \tThis engagement is based upon the associations the viewer brings to the piece and their experience of the piece. This thesis proposes that the sense of touch plays a critical role in the experiential; when you touch something, you connect with it. And when a connection is made, the message can be communicated."
