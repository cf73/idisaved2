            text: "This thesis involves anybody sitting and looking and not necessarily looking to see what they see. The question: is it possible to minimize a form without minimizing the message? Can a reductive process be used to maximize a message? This thesis proposed: yes, by means of something called implication — an implied meaning or understanding arising from a piece of communication which has either a direct or indirect relation to the message. The focus is not on what is shown, but what is imagined by the viewer. Implication is about setting up formal relationships, forming connections, working with contexts, and building an awareness of\_\_intentions and actions. It serves as a way to engage the viewer in the unfolding of a message, and also as a way in which to extend the meaning of the message."

            text: "The idea of a reduced language does not mean a stripping away so that something does not exist, but rather a retaining of what is essential to the meaning of the message. All parts have relevance and everything exists for a reason. Preferably, the elements should carry more than one meaning through the formation of relationships and associations and a focus of intentions through given contexts. Essential to this is form as a support for content — not separate from it.\_"

            text: "Aside\_\_from a given message, form helps one to make those relationships and can also help one to re-see something in a new way. It involves an awareness of intentions and actions, where form is not secondary to the message, but serves as an integral part of it, changing or possibly supporting the message."

            text: "Studies investigating these principles culminated in the document for this thesis which combined the author’s own text by means of its content. It relies on an interaction with the viewer, as the complete message does not expose itself through simple observation, nor does the entire mes-sage arise through a straightforward reading of the manuscript version.\_"
