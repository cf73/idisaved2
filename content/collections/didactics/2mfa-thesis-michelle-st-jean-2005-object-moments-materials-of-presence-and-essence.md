            text: 'Through a search-based methodology, materials and objects have the potential to supersede type and image in the production of meaning. This investigation places an emphasis on material as matter, as physical substance with which we interact and sense in real space and time. Through this process, a dialogue emerges between the 2D and 3D. In the pursuit of three-dimensional experiences, the work generated also results in graphic form that is dimensional and concrete, and captures the spirit of the experience, perhaps more so than the experience itself'
