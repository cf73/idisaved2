            text: "\_the October 29, 1973, issue of Time Magazine. Each single “unit” (defined as a principal idea when confronted with each page) was extracted (literally traced) from each page including the covers, starting with the front cover, and ending with the back cover. This system was retained for the whole book: the pages in the book correspond exactly to the pages in that issue. Any unit traced from that magazine’s issue always retained its relative spatial position on each page in the book which corresponded exactly to the original magazine. Selection of units was always done in a spontaneous manner by a simple process of objective engagement without letting the mind project on it any ideas to “create” or achieve meaning or value of any sort. The only “change” from the original tracings was the photomechanical reduction of the original format (10.5 x 8 inches)\_to allow a lower printing expense."
