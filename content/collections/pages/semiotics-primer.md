            text: 'Looking at this from a semiotic perspective the poster as product for mediation is the Representamen. When that poster is interpreted and becomes an “Object” (i.e., some idea the poster is or can refer to) then the semiosis process helps us understand it as a “sign” — in this case, having mediated the sign as a particular object, we understand its relationship to its source and the purpose it serves as a poster that promotes RISD’s graduate programs. That particular understanding is due to the so-called Interpretant.'

And the relation aspects got on to this being a certain type on institution, what it reflects, being about art, design, students, studios, money, location, etc., ... each of which is actually a sign in its own reality.'
