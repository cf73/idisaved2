  IDI, short for InciteDesignInsight.com, is a comprehensive website that presents an archive of design work under the actions and auspices of Tom Ockerse since 1965.

  The name IDI stands for InciteDesignInsight, a comprehensive website that presents an archive of visual communication design work. The site is an archive of work as the results from various endeavors developed and experienced by Tom Ockerse since he started his design practice, experimental work in 1965, follow also by his teaching of design starting in 1967. IDI presents this broad scope of these relational endeavors under five major topics representing the range from the practical to theoretical. Due to the vast amount of work to become archived this site will continually be updated as more of the work becomes available. The site will also expand to share related works by those who collaborated with Tom.

  The five primary topics are:
  • PRACTICS: represents the visual design work, mostly commissioned to serve clients and audiences, albeit not limited to these practical aspects.
  • POETICS: represents open-ended experiments with the visual language in search of their poetic potential in the use of visual forms, structures, and how these are experienced.
  • DIDACTICS: represents the results of teaching via courses and assignments that searched deeper into design and the use of the “verbivocovisual” of communication to serve its potentials.
  • THEORETICS: represents the broader categories for inquiries stimulated by the work itself and/or by literary and scholarly sources also in search of the principles for meaning, ethics, and value. • TOETICS: represents self-published books and documentations to share work that conventional outlets (publishers, galleries, etc.) found inappropriate.
