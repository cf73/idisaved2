            text: 'Graphic design occupies an ever-expanding, ever-redefined territory at the intersection of verbal and visual languages. Its media spans everything from websites to postcards, film to signage, typefaces to billboards. Its methods make use of both sides of the brain: pairing logic, critical analysis, research,'

Students are exposed to a variety of directions that introduce critical tools, methods and content areas in the field.'

            text: '. Design Studio takes the form of a series of question-based units, each initiated by a faculty member and contextualized by a presentation, event, or workshop. Units may span the entire term, a few weeks, or a single class period. Design Studio, a fast-paced course, necessitates a self-directed, open- ended, experimental and playful mindset. Units do not define outcomes or prescribe processes. Rather they aim to inspire lines of enquiry, and challenge students to explore unfamiliar subject matter, tools, media, and processes by their own initiative. Through the engagements with the tools, materials, and processes of graphic design, project goals serve either the field’s functional context or are the means to self-directed ends.'
