In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). '

            text: ' This project aims to eliminate the often overly simplified Thai cultural stereotypes. It seeks to push forth both Thais and foreigners to look beyond the surface and deeply understand Thailand’s customs and culture. By opening up audiences to the real culture of Thailand, they will ultimately understand why Thailand is often referred to as the ‘Land of Smiles’.'
