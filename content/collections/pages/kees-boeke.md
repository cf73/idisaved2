            text: "In Bilthoven, the Netherlands, is a school called “De Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap” which translates as “The workplace children's community\". It was founded in 1926 by Kees Boeke, a Dutch reformist who advocated pacifism, respect for others, and \"sociocracy\" in which individuals in a community should have equal roles in decision making. The school relies on a Progressive Education concept based on Montessori principles\_and known for it its creative ways to make students and teachers co-responsible as a community for the curriculum. The school is\_still operating today.\_"
