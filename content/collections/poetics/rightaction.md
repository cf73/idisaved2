Rilke, early in his life, was the secretary to the French Sculptor Auguste Rodin. He once asked Rodin “how do you get inspired?” Rodin answered: “Travallier, Travallier, Travallier!” – (Work, Work, Work!). At that time Rilke, as an aspiring poet suffering from writer’s block, needed more, and asked Rodin what advice he could give him for his own lack of inspiration. In reply Rodin told him to visit the Zoo, select one of the animals and study the animal every day for as long as he needed. Rilke took that advice and sat in front of a panther for many days. This experience inspired him to write the poem\_"

Can you imagine with me how glorious it is to in-see a dog, for example, as you pass it — by in-see I don’t mean to look through, which is only a kind of human gymnastics that lets you immediately come out again on the other side of the dog, regarding it merely, so to speak, as a window upon the human world lying behind it: not that; what I mean is to let yourself precisely into the dog’s center, the point from which it begins to be a dog, the place in it where God, as it were, would have sat down for a moment when the dog was finished, in order to watch it during its first embarrassments and inspirations and to nod that it was good, that nothing was lacking, that it couldn’t have been better made. For a while you can endure being inside the dog; you just have to be alert and jump out in time before its environment has completely enclosed you, since otherwise you would simply remain the dog in the dog and be lost for everything else. Though you may laugh, dear confidant, if I tell you where my very greatest feeling, my world-feeling, my earthly bliss was, I must confess to you: it was again and again, here and there in such in-seeing — in the indescribably swift, deep, timeless moments of this God-like in-seeing.”'

The plan was to document this area in some manner, but which process would also reflect the principles we were interested in and had learned about, like “silence”, the use of “right action” for structuring movement, what it means to sense a real time-space area, and what it means to be inside yet outside, external versus intimacy, etc.'

That brought us to consider its opposite with a possible use of the so-called “golden section” in geometry, since this invisible construction was mentioned for its powerful symbolic references in the workshops (and we were familiar with it in design work). Although this structure is an abstract principle, we thought to let its potential use play itself out according to the theosophic principles of the visible versus the invisible.'

We planned to consider these points as stops to address as part of the walk and to move about it in a clockwise manner. This clockwise motion has powerful symbolism for “Life”, as the workshop taught us, being the motion of “LOVE”: with that love entering each of us from the left, then passing within the body through the heart, and then existing from one’s right side.\_"

From that we got the insight to use the photographs themselves on a second walk to rephotograph the printed image in juxtaposition with the area behind it. This second round of photographing with the prints was done on slide film.\_"

This semiotic perspective, based on the semiotics of the American philosopher Charles S. Peirce, Tom taught for years: how we consider the meaning of anything to represent something else. For him semiotics is processed intuitively and naturally whenever he must consider aspects of representation.\_"

WE were also limited in time since this came at the end of the workshop. However, all these limitations we had to face became an integral part of the creative process and only proved to be blessings. One example is the fact that the whole process ended up requiring a lot of spontaneous, intuitive decisions, which in turn reflected other decisions. Another example was that, having only a vague idea of how to share this documentation, only at the end did the structure fall into place with the selection of music, the dissolving of images, the insertion of words, and the reading of quotes all more effectively all combined and realized that depended on intuitively considered, spontaneous combinations, embracing chance and being present in the moments of actions.\_\_"
