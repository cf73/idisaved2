As the philosopher Charles Morris once said:\_"

            text: "A system, a special way of looking at an object, encompasses abstraction arising from identifiable patterns for and within a whole. The key word is pattern. Human beings, intrinsically organizers, become for that reason “pattern seekers”. Partly the basis for design, along with a basic human desire to organize, order, and seek harmony in wholeness, pattern seeking reveals a natural phenomenon for the mechanisms of mind. Perception and thinking reflect the relational phenomena that are essential to the search for meaning, and without relationship meaning is not possible. The more we become aware of relationship the more we come to understand.\_\_"

            text: 'This inherent organizational phenomenon is recognized by psychologists as a “gestalt” principle, hence Gestalt Psychology. In other words, in our search for meaning understanding the patterns or systems help illuminate complexity. Thus, meaning depends on our capacity to see the operating patterns of cause and effect. The more we can take in from this relational dynamic the more we come to understand.'

            text: "Systems as integrated wholes feed back relational values to each of its segments that would otherwise not exist. Quantum physicist David Bohm referred to this principle of wholeness as the implicate order found throughout our universe. Its complexity translates into a sense of beauty, or awe, if you will. Thus, a system is a total working unit that feeds back relational values that would not otherwise exist to each of its segments—the whole being much more than the sum of its parts.\_\_"

            text: "In summary, systems thinking exists as a fundamental principle for all we do. While that may seem to instill in us some apprehension in appearing as a constraint, the truth that understanding the nature and possibilities of systems gives humanity a very liberating tool, becomes a way of looking at something that in return is also a way that tells us something, which can therefore influence and change one’s point of view.\_"
