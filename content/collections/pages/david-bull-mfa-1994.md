            text: 'A look at the linguistic theory that differentiates between the so-called “object language” and “metalanguage.” The sign system that denotes the “object” of a communication forms the object language. The signs that connote meaning indirectly upon the object communicated belong to the metalanguage. Typography is an inescapable part of that metalanguage: when words (naming objects) are set in type, and texts (ideas) are given formal layouts the typographic forms and structures influence the meaning of their contents. That cloaking of the object language in a typographic metalanguage often is the first perceived expression (i.e., before we read the words), which makes it the more critical that designers pay special attention to these meta-components. Whereas designers are often guilty of applying one visual language (style) to everything they design, or remain ignorant of the interplay of form and content (or audience or purpose) this thesis attempts to make the designer more aware of those meta aspects so all important to benefit the communication rather than distract or confuse.'
