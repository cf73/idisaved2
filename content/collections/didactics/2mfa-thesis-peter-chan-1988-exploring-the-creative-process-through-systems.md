            text: "This paper explores the process of designing with computers. In the application of computer-aided-design systems as electronic sketch-boards or production tools, texts and images for printed pages are composed on the computer screen. When microcomputers are used as a new medium for communications, interactive graphic documents are created, displayed and presented to the user on a video monitor. The subject matter of this paper is applied to a typography exercise, in which the same content is presented using the two different media mentioned above.\_"
