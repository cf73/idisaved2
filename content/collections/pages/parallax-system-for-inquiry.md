However, he had rough time because early in the semester his girlfriend broke up their engagement and returned her ring. Kevin's parallax study reflected his sadness by using images of drowning his sorrow in beer.\_In his final video presentation of his parallax study he literally used all parallax studies of his class, his own as well as those from the seven other students, as you’ll see in his movie."
