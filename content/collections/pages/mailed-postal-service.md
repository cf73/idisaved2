            text: "Experiments in Concretism in Mailart, a worldwide activity that intentionally operated via the postal system.\_It was a way for artists in the world to connect with each other and became an instrument to organize connectivity for the purpose to share ones work internationally without the limits of conventional outlets such as museums and galleries. Moreover, the exchange for anything to become organized (exhibited, documented as a book for exchange) it was an unwritten rule to be accepted and remain unedited. It was clearly a contradiction to the institutional world of art.\_"

It originated by those involved in the Fluxus activities (late 1950s/early 1960s) which intentionally looked to circumvent conventional systems (galleries, publishers, spaces, etc.) of presumed “authority” who determined what art is what it is not. This opened up of the potentials for all the creative arts, opening the door to the unlimited, which not only spilled over into all the arts (visual, verbal, sound, and performance) but deleted the respective boundaries and so-called expertise—thus viewing “art” as one thing.\_"

            text: "Mail art also proved itself a vital networking to connect with others around in the world—literally predating the internet web capacities we have today! As a communication system for this world community of the arts (without any boundaries of type as well) it was used by hundreds of artists around the world, with its results as valid as anything we have of that sort today.\_"
