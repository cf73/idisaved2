            text: 'My investigations have been sparked by thinking about the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus’ voyage westward. I am juxtaposing representations of cultural, regional, corporate, and personal identities. I am trying to establish a critical voice that communicates through work. I continue to explore ways to communicate the complexity of a contemporary sense of identity where culture conflicts with money, power, and bureaucracy, which in turn conflict with human dignity. I have grown suspicious of the divisiveness of the “multicultural” debate and would like to find some way which two or more cultures can be represented equivocally, and not as one being a footnote to the other.'
