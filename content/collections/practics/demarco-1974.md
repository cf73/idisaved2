            text: 'The design of a special catalogue for a unique event organized and created by Richard Demarco (Richard Demarco Gallery) that included: an international summer program for invited artists, poets, teachers, students, and theorists; documented gallery exhibitions; and documentation of public events held in the gallery during the 1974 Edinburgh Arts Festival, Edinburgh, Scotland. The catalogue design was done with assistance by a RISD undergraduate student in graphic design, Carol Reynolds, who also attended the events.'
