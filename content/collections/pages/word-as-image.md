She places these words in environments, which of course have an enormous impact on how we engage with them— but still, it is about the words she selects, their verbal potency, and the language they are presented in.'

In this example the text is merely placed inside a space, and has already some line spacing, but not other visual elements to help us disinguish more of the parts form the whole.'

When the latter is done correctly it begins to serve as a voice for the purposeful means to communicate, as it should!'
