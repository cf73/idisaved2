            text: "Graphic design has traditionally been directed toward didactic and hortatory presentations. The client hires the designer to present information and to motivate the viewer. The relationship among the participants in this process is unidirectional and hierarchical. Designer and viewer become means to the ends of the client.\t"

            text: 'I object to this model of design on two basic grounds. The first is political. The second is conceptual. Politically, the traditional model is objectionable because it encourages passivity and alienation. As viewers, persons are taught to expect that what they should know or want will be dispensed to them.'

            text: "They need only function as containers for externally created knowledge and motives. Knowledge becomes a product to acquire rather than a process in which to engage. Alienation is exacerbated by an environment thick with design that treats viewers as passive containers or manipulable actors. Such design denies that persons are themselves sources of knowledge and value. It conveys the idea that satisfaction and success are to be found in the acquisition and consumption of product. The citizen in such a culture develops a chronic sense of powerlessness and becomes alienated from others, who are seen either as powerful manipulators or as competitors in a contest for acquisition.\t"

            text: 'Conceptually, the traditional model ignores holism in the theory of how symbols have meaning. The traditional model assumes that meanings are fixed objects that can be furnished by the client, represented by the designer, and grasped by the viewer. But meaning is not an object to be transmitted in a linear, hierarchical fashion. Meaning arises in an endless process of creation. Semiotics teaches that objects are themselves representations, and that representations are always understood through a process'

            text: "The aim of my thesis is to encourage my audience to become aware of the process by which they create meaning. My designs break down the barriers between client, designer, and viewer. They encourage physical participation and an active process of discovery. If my designs are successful, they enable their audience to experience the shifting positions of object, representation, and interpretant as an active syntheses. They empower people to see themselves as sources of value and understanding.\t"

            text: 'In this sense, I have no “product” to present; no “object” to represent. I seek to deconstruct the hierarchical model in which an object is given to the designer, who then creates a product that is received by the viewer. I hope in this way to teach not propositional knowledge, or knowing “that;” but rather an understanding of the process of creating meaning–a form of knowing “how.”'
