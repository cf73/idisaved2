            text: 'In this thesis investigation abstraction does not describe a style but refers to a process in which new ideas are generated and the designer''s motives ate evaluated. How do we know abstraction is a process and not a label for design? What are the factors associated with abstraction and why is it important that graphic designers know more about it?'

            text: 'The focus of this investigation is on the process behind the abstracted form that confronts us, not the form itself. What is discovered from the results of this investigation ate a series of actions leading the designer through an evolving process culminating in a final product.'

            text: 'A series of posters depicting the Rhode Island School of Design''s graduate program in graphic design serve as a subject for the study of abstraction in the design process. Analytically, abstraction is used as a method evaluating the individual components of each composition. As a tool, abstraction exposes hidden meaning concealed by a form''s shape and its specific interpretation. Analysis of all abstracted forms and their meaning have been synthesized into a final poster proving to be clear and meaningful.'
