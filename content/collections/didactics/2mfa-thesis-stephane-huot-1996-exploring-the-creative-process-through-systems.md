            text: 'This thesis investigates how systems can help designers become more open-minded in the design process. Systems are paradoxical: as generative tools they structure and limit, but they also open doors to the infinite. The use of systems brings an externalized objectivity to the subjective creative process which enables designers to become aware of unexpected relationships they might not have noticed otherwise.'

            text: 'Systems can help generate unusual forms to stimulate new thoughts, and diminish preconditioned expectations for the designer. As underlying invisible principles, systems affect holistic thinking, and therefore help us see unity in diversity, order in complexity, and relate parts into a cohesive whole.'

            text: 'Systems provide the open-minded designer with possibilities, not necessarily solutions. These possibilities may lead to a solution that would not otherwise have been found. Employing subjectivity alone, the designer may choose solutions purposefully, but not without preconceived conventions.'
