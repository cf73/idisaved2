            text: 'Communication is bi-directional. Like a game of Ping Pong, it is a constant exchange loop between two entities, two minds, two perspectives. As a designer, I bring attention to the components that make up this exchange as a dynamic system.'

            text: 'I envision how graphic design reflects these temporary qualities as a model for visual communication. Just as we never throw the ball in the same way, I begin by observing the gradual nature of change. Even when change seems abrupt, it is the result of a hidden accumulation of small events. I am interested in how design can activate communication by paying attention to how we aim, and the gestural cues and conditions that shape the direction of each exchange.'

            text: 'I light the fire to an infinite response loop for breaking the hierarchy between the designer and the user, communicator and the viewer, the world and my perceptions. It is an ongoing search to understand continuously our temporary existence.'
