These\_10 “found” concrete poems are of USA postage stamps found on envelopes, fused with their postal cancellations. The accidental fusion of words and images resulted in poetic statements that were quite amazing—especially in the context of this action via a government agency."

            text: "This series of prints present the viewer with a different kind of “stamp collection”— one that focuses attention on the relationship of existing postage stamps found with their cancellations on mailed envelopes. Although their relationships may appear obvious to serve their practical purpose and thus not require any further attention, this creates an unexpected expressive result with often a powerful poetic result—which we tend to overlook due to their small scale (and indeed, we often overlook the small things in life!).\_"

            text: "The poetic results range from the humorous to the revolting. In most cases the subject matter used our country’s representations of symbols—which creates the ironic note that the combined graphic elements were actually created by one of our governmental offices. That said, imagine for a moment the reality that our government “promotes” the very idea that “war is better business”, or decided to shoot holes through our national flag, or made a Duchamp’s Mona Lisa out of Eleanor Roosevelt!\_"
