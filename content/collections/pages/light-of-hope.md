            text: "While suffering was accented by the 2004 tsunami, the Indonesian people have suffered for decades from a variety of calamities. They suffered continual exploitation and domination by foreign countries, namely India and Islamic countries, as well as the English, the Dutch (who named it the Dutch East Indies), and Japan. Indonesia gained its independence soon after WW2. Yet, since then, its government has suffered from collusion, nepotism, power struggles, deception, poverty and greed. In the meantime, natural disasters such as the tsunami of 2004 continued.\_\_"

            text: "Frankly, this project was close to my heart. I was born in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1940, to Dutch parents who were helping govern the colony. I remember hardly anything from my first 5 years there\_\_--\_\_fortunate, perhaps, since my family ended up in Japanese concentration camps during WW2 and lost everything, including my father who died in a concentration camp in Burma. My mother wisely got us back to Holland, where we lived until we immigrated to the USA in1957 to start life anew. I always have had a deep sense of fondness for the Indonesian people and feel much closer to them then I was ever able to feel for the Dutch. Clearly, while I have only been back to Indonesia for a week’s visit in the late 1990s, part of my heart remained there. All this made the Light of Hope project a most welcome invitation!\_"

            text: "After a contemplative process, ideas for the poster began to unfold. My perception always has been that the Indonesians are a gentle, kind, warm, and open-hearted people, with a deep sense of humanism\_\_--\_\_a nature that persists in spite of constant adversities. While being so continually engulfed by external darkness and evil, they always seemed to carry a light within. So I felt a need to convey the nature of this light. To me, it is a light we all want to receive, to gain from the world outside, not to succumb to our struggles within."

If we think of ourselves as light bearers, then this light will flow out and will touch others—who in turn will shed the light further. Indeed, we do have the power to light the world!'
