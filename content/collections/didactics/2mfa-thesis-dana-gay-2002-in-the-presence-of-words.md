            text: 'Words. We are surrounded by them and use them everyday. We see them, we speak them, we read them, we write them. Rarely however do we truly enter the sacredness of their small spaces. Words are not mere agglomerations of letters. They are portals to fantasy and imagination. They hold voice and vision. The process of invisioning words - of truly seeing inside them and discovering their potential to express and speak out, to capture moments in time, to contain meaning and mood, to tell stories, and command space - is the impulse of this thesis search. It uncovers the potential that words have to communicate on a deeper level than merely speaking, reading, or writing them. To be in the presence of words is to engage them as living matter and use them as typographic landscapes that stimulate imagination and simultaneously engage sight, sound, feeling, and praise.'
