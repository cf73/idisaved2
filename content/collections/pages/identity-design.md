  Corporate Identity, Symbols, Branding

  Since the beginning of his career as a graphic designer, “corporate identity” design (generalized today as “branding”) was a major design activity. That interest began during his studies at Yale University (1963-65), in courses with Norman Ives, Paul Rand, and Alvin Eisenman. After that this interest was particularly stimulated during his first job at J. K. Fogleman Associates in Morristown, NJ (1965-67). Jim Fogleman, following his long and illustrious career at CIBA and having pioneered CIBA’s corporate design standards, decided in 1965 to start his own design firm in his hometown of Morristown. His studio’s primary clients included various companies from the chemical industry (Ciba, Hoffman LaRoche, Interchem, Syntex), plus other corporations like the newly formed IPI (International Printing Ink) company. 

  These notes about Jim Fogleman were posted on an older website:

  Ciba Pharmaceuticals hired James K. Fogleman in 1951 as design director of the U.S. Ciba subsidiary located in Summit, NJ. Known as a pioneer of corporate identity, he employed gifted designers and established Ciba’s reputation through a consistently applied modernist identity program (a nice contrast with the expressive, painterly materials done by James McMullan for Roche Laboratories in the mid 1960s).

  Fogleman brought Chermayeff & Geismar on board to design Ciba’s house organ Sidelights, plus many other brochures and booklets targeted at doctors. The Sidelights covers are worthy of their own future post but I was most interested in the diagrams and charts that appear within the publications. Most of the Sidelights issues profiled a particular department and began with a chart illustrating the hierarchy of workers. A more abstract version of the organizational chart appeared in C&G’s booklet for Xerox’s Dual Ladder program.

  In 1970 Ciba merged with Geigy, which was also in the vanguard of modernist design. Geigy had been employing heavy hitters like Fred Troller, Armin Hofmann, George Giusti, and Steff Geissbuhler (who joined Chermayeff & Geismar’s studio in 1975). Fogleman went on to co-find the landmark design firm Unimark in 1965 with Massimo Vignelli, Ralph Eckerstrom, Wally Gutches, Larry Klein, Robert Moldafsky, and Bob Noorda.

  Tom left Jim Fogleman’s studio in 1967, when he was recruited to teach at Indiana University, and began there as Assistant Professor. However, he also continued his design work in the design studio under his own name and has done work for numerous companies and products requiring identity design. This video shares a selection of some of identity designs, mainly focused on logos, dating from 1965 through current times.
