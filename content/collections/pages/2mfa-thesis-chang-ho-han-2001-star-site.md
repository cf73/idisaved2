            text: 'Communication is like a vessel into which meaning is poured and from which meaning is derived. By the choices designers make (to pour into the vessel what is needed) these become the impulses to stimulate the consumer''s imagination. My investigation is about stars as the material for consumption in this vessel of communication. The star-shape figure exists everywhere and persistently as an active visible element that is part of our global language, a form of expression used throughout social history. This thesis explores the socio-cultural implications of the star, and it use. Through the reinterpretation of its socio-cultural values, the thesis also produces new practical applications by integrating it with different socio-cultural hierarchies.'
