            text: "The A-Z Book is a\_boxed book of 52 bound pages, using the (Latin) alphabet as content. Letters are partly printed or reveal themselves as the user experiences the turning the pages via die cuts and partial pages. This book has won a number of awards (including Fifty Best Books in 1971). While it appears to be a book for children it proved itself for adults as well, as a poetic experience full of surprises. Consequently, it played a major role during the worldwide “concrete poetry” movement (± late-1950s to mid-1970s). New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was eager to publish it, but discovered that became prohibitive since die cutting required unusual accuracy and the books had to be hand collated, punched and bound. That allowed Colorcraft Lithographers Inc., one of the MoMA bidders for printing, to publish the book instead.\_"
