title: Poetics
summary: |-
  POETICS covers a broad scope of experiments that embrace the use of words, sounds, experiences and actions using the visual language to create poetic experiences. Works are based on the theories and principles of Concretism in which the means serve to draw out the essence and spirit from what is presented and experienced. In this topic the nature of experiences such as concrete poetry, visual systems, bookworks, documentations, events, etc., characterize the work.

  The heading of POETICS is preferred over the term FINE ARTS since the latter tends to link more with traditional references like painting,drawing, and sculpture. Rather, POETICS embraces a broader scope of work that includes the creative experiments with words, sound and activities. This also reflects Tom’s interests since the 1960s in the so-called avant-garde. He participated in such activities like Concrete Poetry, Fluxus and Mailartwhich purposely looked to break away from tradition, established conventions, habit and the limits of the conditioned mind. 

  Moreover, these works experimented especially with the means to inquire deeper into the nature of CONCRETISM. This term was first formulated by Theo van Doesburg in 1930 as Concrete Art. Van Doesburg, as leader of the 1930s De Stijl group in Holland that included Piet Mondrian, felt it necessary to differentiate between his vision of “abstract” art and that of other works, wherein artists of that time also used abstract shapes. He basically tried to clarify that the art the De Stijl group made was not merely based on the abstraction of shapes relative to forms seen in the external world; rather their abstract shapes were meant to represent the “invisible” or “spirit” that was felt to be within the objects viewed and experienced in the external world. (See THEORETICS for more information on Concretism.)
