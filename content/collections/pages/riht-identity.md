This was a major project accepted by Tom and his new design studio (which established with another professor at RISD, Mihai Nadin), and had the participation of RISD graduate students to assist.\_The whole process makes a valuable case study for identity design."

            text: 'When Tom and his partner were approach by RIHT the work was accepted under the expressed condition by the studio to assure that it would be able to proceed in this project according to its design principles for “corporate identity design” and become a process from which other could learn from. The latter was a basis for the studio’s reason for being, which it perceived as a studio based on educational interests. That process for the corporate identity design included the principles of first making a thorough analysis of the company itself, and its reasons for being, from which would unfold as a holistic conception for identity that would include the name and its use, based on the standards for design that expressed the company’s idealisms. Note that this approach at other design studios was considered too time consuming, nor necessarily felt necessary, and preferred the more superficial process for the development of a mark or logo design (that would wow the client!), from which the rest of the identity design standards would unfold from the visual form of the logo and whatever values it held. We also told RIHT that if we were to follow this process they would have to expect this process to take at least several months, and completion in one year. RIHT agreed to that, and we were contracted.'

            text: 'The Rhode Island Hospital Trust''s advertising agencies used their new name in a poorly formulated public identity wherein the logo was applied to eveything without ever having established any other graphic "standards" for this public face. For example, while the company established the interest to use the color blue as part of their identity, that color remained uncontrolled. Also the use of type meant to use any font, style or layout on a subjective basis, without any standards.'

            text: 'After a thorough start for study and analysis for several weeks RIHT became anxious to get at least something going on its “identity”—so we created an “interim” design, complete with a standards manual for immediate use. We did make this solid from a conceptual perspective, but with a “logo” design that would not be too attractive to cause RIHT to want to keep it. We also took a stance to play on their interest that identified the Hospital Trust building as a central point in Providence. All that made RIHT happy.'

This was done with the mutual understanding that the logo design and any further applications of it would be guided by our standards and views. Of course, this identity design program resulted in another standards manual.'
