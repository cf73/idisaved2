            text: 'We experience the world first via our senses to assemble the meaning of things and our own relationships to them. This thesis explores particularly what happens when this awareness engages our curiosity and confronts us with the unexpected. Expectations must be challenged for unexpected meetings of the senses are conduits to explore what we have grown accustomed to, yielding new relationships and therefore new insights. These principles of this thesis are explored through work in exhibition, environmental and book design. As a participant of these conveniences I understand their use. As a designer, I want to counterbalance their effects. As a result a richer experience unfolds for both audience and designer.'
