The term “mind-map” was popularized by British psychologist Tony Buzan, in the late 1970s; and inspired by Alfred Korzybski’s General Semantics theory. However, the term “mind-map” is somewhat misleading since the system does not truly “map the mind”, but merely documents aspects of “thought” and insight. Actually, long before Buzan others used the same mapping system for similar purposes (e.g., 3rd cent. Greek philosopher, Porphyry, used it to map out Aristotle’s categories; Ernest Wood, 1930s, used this as a means to train concentration skills).\_"
