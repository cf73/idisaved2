            text: 'As interpersonal communication, gift-giving and the considerable portion of gift-gestures that falls into the graphic design domain deserves attention from the design community; however, because of a dearth of information, a designer disdain for the commercial vernacular, and a gender bias, there is a lack of regard for gift-giving as a significant social phenomenon. As a result , there is a lack of consideration for the material expression of gift-gestures in the marketplace.'

            text: 'The goal of this study is two-part. Drawing insight from two authorities on gift-giving, one in traditional non-western cultures and one in contemporary western society, the intention of this study is to raise the design communityâ€™s awareness of the significance of gift-giving. Secondly, this study aims to encourage a credible designer contribution - one that vitalizes, enriches, even transforms conventional gift gestures. Beginning with a discussion of the contemporary mainstream gift industry, the role of convention is considered. Continuing with a series of visual studies, the merits of departing from convention are explored with the goal of creating value in the gift as a symbol of relations. Loosely grouped by signs of value, a design resolve does not characterize the visual work. Rather a search for idea, a moment, or a physical gesture is primary. Collectively they create a visual enthusiasm for gift -giving.'
