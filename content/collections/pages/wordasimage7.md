You can decide for yourself if you prefer this one over the typewriter version. The Hansjorg Mayer version does add certain aspects the other version does not have, but does this help the reader expand information or does it "direct" meaning in a certain way and thereby limit content? This is reflective of the challenge with typography for designers!'

At IU I met Mary Ellen, who was a professor in English at the University, and who then became a student of mine when her interested took her into my typography courses. We became good friends and inspired each other on our separate discoveries and interpretations of concrete poetry. We had many, many memorable discussions on issues I have shared. We both appreciated how we learned from each other. Also, Mary Ellen was able to bring a variety of concrete poets from all over the world to Bloomington, Indiana, which had meanwhile become a hot world center for concrete poetry interests. Mary Ellen eventually published a major source for that: '

This came about after I did the original version (left side) for a postcard format to participate in a mailart project in 1967 and had limited space and typesetting technology. It''s interesting to compare what each has that is not in the other. First of all the blocks of type (especially in the right version) do not even question if there is anything missing—the blocks of the alphabet look perfect—until one realizes that it is not possible for 26 letters to fit in a square, hence the search starts how that is made possible and we discover that each one has a letter is missing which together spells the word "G O N E". The right version becomes a much more interesting experience which experience with it reveals deeper and expanded insight into the nature of this object as a poem.'

I plan to have a more extensive devotion to Ian's work on my website because he also became a major influence on my own works of concrete poetry. Briefly, Ian was an artist/poet living in Scotland. After years of exhibits etc, he needed up living in a remote part of farm land where he ended up making his garden a work of poetry and where his poetry lived in turn. Ian was not shy to collaborate with other experts to help him achieve the best possible means for his word-works to life—like calligraphers, stone carvers, wall-builders, etc. "
