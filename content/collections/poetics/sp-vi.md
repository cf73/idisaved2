The prints (made during a three-year period, 1965-68) resulted from studies using only this pattern of two main spirals and their sub-spirals. From these studies fifteen were selected to become this limited-edition portfolio of serigraphs. It serves also as an early example of Tom’s interest into\_"

            text: 'These prints represent a study in a systemic way of two interactive spirals. This involves two basic spirals (“A” and “B”) each having sub-spirals (“a” and “b”). The main two spirals are made up of a total of 612 squares, each square of the same size. Each main spiral has a subset of squares in the center of each main square. The squares in the sub-spirals change in size in a pattern of enlargement or reduction via 8 sizes. Furthermore, these changes start in the center of spirals A and B, then (moving counterclockwise) the squares in spiral “a” change from size 1 to size 8, then continue to get smaller to size 1 again. This pattern continues. At the same time the other set moves in an opposite way, starting with the largest size, going smaller, then getting larger again. This basic system remains constant throughout this series.'

            text: 'Each spiral and the background have a separate color, thus creating five possible combinations. By varying the colors, the overall visual effect will change, as well as the moods being expressed by these changes. For instance, when two colors are used, their combinations may either bring out two strong spirals or lose the spiral effect all together, leaving only soft square rings. The interaction of colors obviously is of prime importance. Furthermore, colors may combine with each other to create on optical similarity, while actually being different.'
