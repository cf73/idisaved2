These poems are Tom’s early experiments in concrete poetry from the period 1967-1970. The distinguished Danish poet Vagn Steen, one of the first Danish poets to work with concrete poetry and systems poetry, wrote an introduction to T.O.P. with his expanded insights into the nature of visual poetry.'
