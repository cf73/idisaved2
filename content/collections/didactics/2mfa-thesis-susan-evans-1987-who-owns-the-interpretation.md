            text: "This thesis addresses the issue of the aesthetic function and its relation to design, the definition and evaluation of the aesthetic component in design. For my evaluation, I have chosen a selection of children’s portraits - the work of Sir Jacob Epstein, the American born British Sculptor. Through the interpretation of these works, I have become familiar with the concept of aesthetic value pertinent to art. Through a visual interpretation of these works, I try to develop a dialogue in order to speak about the expressive quality, the value of the portraits, the Epstein identity. My subject is, first, the aesthetic value of the work, by which I understand the expressive function. In turn, I have to make use of the aesthetic function of design - its value and criteria for evaluation.\_"

            text: 'While a work of art as an object of aesthetic value is primarily involved with the aesthetic function, a piece of design is defined first by its communicative value, determined in relation to its communication function. The design process is the search for an appropriate visual form to convey information in a clear and meaningful way. Yet a clear message alone is not always meaningful. It is the aesthetic component implicit to the design process through which we, as designers, can assert our conception and interpretation and make it accessible to others. The aesthetic component structures our messages through a clear and meaningful visual form. It confers relevance to the design.'

            text: 'Through the design process the designer brings the identity of the subject to expression. First the designer identifies the value - the identity of the subject - through research and visual search. This interpretation is a critical interpretation made in relation to the intention or purpose of the piece, the pragmatic context. The function of this piece is the explication of the aesthetic function of design through a designed object, making designers aware of the critical role that the aesthetic component plays in the complex activity of design. The vehicle for the exploration is a series of plates in which the aesthetic value of the sculpture is identified and expressed. The identity of a work of art is what makes it different from other works of the same kind, the way the artist identifies himself in the work, the way he brings his subject to expression. The designer in turn searches for the expressive form - the identity of the artist - and brings that form to expression. He brings the value of the work to expression. The designer expresses the identity of the artist rather than his own identity or an identity of design. Design as such should disappear in the designed object. Design should function to communicate the identity of its subject, which in turn becomes the visual identity or value of design.'

            text: '“Who owns the interpretation?” At the beginning, Epstein owns the interpretation. The artist interprets his subject - the children - and creates the work - the portrait. The designer interprets the interpretation, the Epstein. In the end the interpretation is never possessed, it is open for re - and re - and re - interpretation. The aesthetic value makes the work open to infinite interpretations. The artist gives up his subjective interpretation to the creation of the object - the work. The work of art is the objectification of the artist’s subjective experience. The designer, on the other hand, accepts to act as mediator; to communicate certain messages in respect to specific functions and goals. The designer must define the function or functions to be expressed and identify the value of the subject in relation to these goals. The designer is never free in his interpretation of the subject. The designer interprets the subject from a critical perspective. Through this interpretation the designer brings his subject to expression.'
