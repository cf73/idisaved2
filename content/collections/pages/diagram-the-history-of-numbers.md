            text: 'A graphic interpretation of the history of numbers was originally designed to accompany the article by Ramon Cardenas, published in the 1971 issue of the quarterly magazine by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. The image for the article caused a demand for extra copies; and when none were left PMM decided to publish a poster version of it.'

Bowles, an associate editor of WORLD Magazine (a quarterly published by the financial firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co / PMM&Co) invited Tom Ockerse to \Lcreate some visual experiments with numbers to serve as illustrations for an article on the history of numbers.

Tom agreed but other things distracted him from being able to attend to this commission. A few days before the deadline the editor pushed Tom to submit at least something—so under pressure Tom finally began his process, which first meant to read the article itself.\_\_"

            text: 'After reading it one thing immediately stood out in Tom’s mind: a spiraling structure that logically followed the articles history in which the hand was central and from which marks evolved to serve their needs of a culture, their practical use, and their varied designs that match their context (typographic fonts etc.). Tom quickly produced that and hoped the editor would be happy enough with that since no more time for experimentation was left. It turned out the editor was elated! In fact, so much that he felt this single graphic configuration not only covered most of the article’s historical information but told the “story” much more eloquently! As a result (with the approval of Ramon Cardenas, WORLD magazine decided to drop the written text and simply present this spiraled graphic in the magazine’s center fold. On the page before the centerfold were a few summary notes about this and credited Ramon with his research.'

PMM&Co then sold this, and soon again ran out of copies due to its popularity.\_"
