            text: 'This slip cased portfolio holds 10 silkscreened prints of “found” concrete poems. The prints are enlarged US postage stamps with their postal cancellations found on mailed envelopes, in which their accidental fusions of words and images created a unique sense of poetics. Each print is signed by the artist/poet. A limited portfolio edition of 25 numbered copies, 43 x 43 cm.'
