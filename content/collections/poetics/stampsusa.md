            text: "\_the process also produced many test prints. While these proof prints have no special value and are usually trashed, after observing them more carefully they revealed an option to use them for a bookwork. The interest was not merely to make merely a single original as a one-of-a-kind (nor to print an offset edition since that was not affordable). However, it happened to coincide with that fact that RISD obtained one of the first colored xerox machines, and after some tests with that equipment a small edition of copies suddenly became possible."

            text: 'The color xerox machine did not always work that well and presented glitches in the printing—but these “mistakes” were then embraced as added value and became an integral part of the book, which after all was a kind of “PS” (postscript) result caused by “chance” operations. Hence the book’s title.'
