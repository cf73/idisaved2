            text: 'A presence of being can be recognized in the absence of words. What then, is the web of our connectedness? How are our fibers linked? This thesis probes deeply into the pre-verbal "babblings" of unlearning and unknowing; a submission to be attentive to the moment and to seek relationships. Through papermaking, bookmaking, photography, sculpture and exhibition I have discovered an inner wisdom, a connection to ancient, unspoken truths. Hidden meanings are uncovered, unveiled. Muse... I am awakened to empathy and to a renewed level of awareness-- a multiplicity of possibilities. A multitude of connections. Mutiny... I trust this awareness as a transformative experience. There are no words. No explanations are necessary. It is the beginning of a new vocabulary, the beginning of learning. It is the presence of silence.'
