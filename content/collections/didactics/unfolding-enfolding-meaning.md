            text: "looks deeply into the function of meaning for design as interface for communication and action. We\_will inquire into the nature of the design process from two perspectives: 1) how ideas are processed to help unpack meaning relative to complexity and vagueness; and 2) how meaning is packaged into a thoughtful design interface.\_"

            text: "Our ever-changing social and media-dependent environment increasingly demands that designers understand how to design the interfacing objects that help others navigate this web of meaningful relationships. Without that understanding design is limited to empty form, senseless embellishment, and uninspired repetition.\_"

            text: "This course offers practical insight into the mechanisms of meaning for relational design via semiotics and mindful action. While semiotics is known as a logical (rational) system for analysis and critical thinking, more importantly for designers is its use as a tool to generate creative, original and optimal results. However, this rational approach becomes most useful when this integrates with the intuitive sensibilities that draw from our inner intelligence as the ground for consciousness.\_"

            text: 'Early studio work helps establish the common ground for the use of semiotic theory: as a tool for analysis and for critical making in design; to understand theory and practice as necessary partners; and to ultimately enable the application of theory to individualized interests.'
