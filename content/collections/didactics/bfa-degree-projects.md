            text: 'is an independent project in graphic design studies that requires the student to develop a body work in consultation with a faculty advisor, culminating in a finished product. Also, the BFA Degree Project is a final course and project requirement for students to complete their RISD undergraduate education. However, it is important for each student to view the BFA Degree Project not as an “end”; rather, as a BEGINNING: an opportunity to develop a personal line of inquiry toward becoming a graphic designer.'

            text: 'The BFA Degree Project, defined by the student, reflects the individual’s interest in voice and practice. Like any good investigation, as students have seen so far in the design curriculum, the BFA Degree Project should be guided by questions. The goal of the BFA Degree Project is not a set of answers to those questions, but more a synthesis of the design inquiry through experimentation and articulation. Other rubrics — like theory, craft, and audience — are also important, depending on the project.'

            text: 'While the bulk of work occurs usually during the final (spring) semester, planning for a BFA Degree Project starts in the Fall, if not before, with a BFA Degree Project proposal due at the end of the semester. This is a chance to begin an internal conversation, along with faculty, peers and others. The BFA Degree Project should be as enjoyable as it is educational.'
