            text: 'Mail art, while not necessarily characteristics as today’s world of art, had been an active and growing activity in past decade among the avant-garde. At least partially created out of the need and desire to circumvent the limitations of established outlets for exhibition and publishing, with whose traditions and conventions so many artists today are characteristically in conflict, it has become an exciting and vital alternative and as a communication system used by hundreds of artists around the world, with its results as valid as anything out there today.'

Each person who submitted work to the mail art exhibition was accepted and exhibited, (i.e., no editing of artists or their work, since exclusion would be to violate the basic concept and principles of mail art). Which is not to say that there were so that there were no “irrelevant” works included, but any such editing was left up to the individual/viewer/reader/listener.'
